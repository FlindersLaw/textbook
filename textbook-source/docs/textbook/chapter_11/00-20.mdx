:::caution
This page is heavily dependent on the old LLAW3301 GitHub repository.  It should not be set 
for students until references to the TeachingCode repository are updated or removed.

:::caution 
The rest of this textbook assumes that you have signed up for GitHub 
and connected your GitHub account to Docassemble.

Make sure you have [signed up for GitHub and connected your GitHub account
to Docassemble](00-10).

As we move on in this book our code will become more and more complex.
Instead of typing your exercises in by hand (or copying them from this book),
all the code used in this textbook is available on GitHub.

GitHub is an online
tool that coders use to work together on code.  Coding projects are stored
in *repositories*.  Coders can *pull* down a local copy of a repository 
(or *repo*) which they can work on and modify.  Changes that a user makes
are not synchronised back up to the cloud until a user *commits* and *pushes*
their changes back up to the cloud.

You will be using GitHub to collaborate with your project team members.

But for now, you can use GitHub to pull down a copy of the example code 
used in this textbook into your Playground.

:::tip
You might want to pull the teaching code down into a new [Project](https://docassemble.org/docs/playground.html#projects) so your
Default Playground doesn't get cluttered.

## Pulling Down the Teaching Code
### Making a Project
Let's create a new project and call it 'TeachingCode' (spaces aren't allowed
in project names)

Click on 'Playground' and select 'Manage Projects'
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/chapter_02/github1.png' />

Click on 'Add a New Project'
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/chapter_02/github2.png' />

Create a new project called `TeachingCode` and press <Components.DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_save_prop} />
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/chapter_02/github3.png' />

You should now be in your new Playground.  In the top-left of the black
navbar you will see 'Playground / TeachingCode'.

Now let's pull the code down from GitHub.  Click on the 'Folders' menu,
then click 'Packages'
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/chapter_02/github4.png' />

Click 'Pull'
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/chapter_02/github5.png' />

In the GitHub URL enter <Components.DisplayConstants data={teachingcodeurl} />
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/chapter_02/github6.png' />

Click on <Components.DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_save_prop} button_text='Pull' />

You will be returned to the Package screen.  A banner will appear across the top
of your screen telling you the repository (or 'package') has been uploaded
and you will also notice the Package name has changed and information about
the package has been populated.
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/chapter_02/github7.png' />

Click on `<Back` to go to your playground.  Click on the Folders menu and 
you will see a list of files from the package.
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/chapter_02/github7.png' />

You now have a copy of all the code used in this textbook in your local
Playground.  That should save you a bit of typing as we move on.
