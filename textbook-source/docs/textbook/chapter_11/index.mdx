title: Chapter 11. Collaborating with GitHub
---
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

This chapter currently contains material that describes how to connect to GitHub and
introduces GitHub. This material used to be in Chapters 1 and 2 but was moved to here
as students that don't need to use GitHub are working through these steps regardless.

The rest of this chapter should be completed using the content of the G videos. These
videos were pretty thorough and could probably just be transcribed over.
