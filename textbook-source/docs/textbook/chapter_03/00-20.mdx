    Let's say you want to test the value in `MJFage` to check that it equals 65.  which
    test would you use?
    <Answer>
    `MJFage = 65`
    </Answer>
    <Answer>
    `MJFage = '65'`
    </Answer>
    <Answer isCorrect>
    `MJFAge == 65`
    </Answer>
    <Explanation correctAnswer>
    Correct!  You've correctly identified that the test for equality is `==` and not `=`.
    Also, because you're testing a numerical value you need to check that `MJFage` is equal to
    the number `65` and not the text string `'65'`.
    </Explanation>
    <Explanation incorrectAnswer>
    Try again.  Remember:

    1. that you're testing the value of a number and not text; and
    1. to use the correct test for equality

<Quizlet>
    This is a **Quizlet** component.  It's used to display quizlets in the textbook.  The 
    component consists of:

    1. a Quiz question
    2. One or more answers; and
    3. Explanations for the answers.

    What you are reading now forms part of the quiz question.  It appears as the first content
    after opening with the `<Quizlet>`.

    #### Title
    You can give your quiz a title by using the `title` keyword ie: `<Quizlet title='My Quiz Title'>`.

    #### Quizlet content
    A question can contain Markdown and HTML, in fact pretty much anything you can put in a MDX file, 
    including other components.

    Here's an example of a code block.

    ```python
    if this_works:
        status='happy'
    else:
        status='sad'
    ```
    #### Answers
    Answers can also contain rich content. See below for example answers.  One or more answers 
    can be marked as correct answers, although only one answer can ever be selected at a time.  The 
    answers in this quiz below explain in more detail how the `<Answer>` component works.

    #### Explanations
    You can optionally provide detailed explanations to display when the user selects a correct or
    incorrect answer.  By default, an Explanation will appear whenever an incorrect answer is 
    displayed.  You need to set the `correctAnswer` flag in the `<Explanation>` to mark an explanation
    to appear when a correct answer is clicked. Click on a correct and incorrect answer below and scroll
    to the end of this Quiz block to see how explanations work.


    <Answer isCorrect>
    This is the correct answer.  That's because the `isCorrect` flag
    has been set in the `<Answer>`.  Technically, there can be more
    than one correct answer but only one answer at a time can ever
    be selected.

    When an answer is selected it is highlighted in 
    <span class="correctAnswer">green</span>.

    Click on this answer to see.
    </Answer>
    <Answer>
    Any answer remains selected until another answer is clicked.  This answer is an
    incorrect answer.  This is signified by omitting `isCorrect` in the component header.
    
    This answer will be highlighted in <span class="incorrectAnswer">red</span> when it
    is clicked.
    </Answer>
    <Explanation correctAnswer>
    This is an explanation for the correct answer.  You set this by opening with `<Explanation correctAnswer>`.

    Like questions and answers, you can also include rich content in your explanations, even 
    flowcharts!

    ```mermaid
    flowchart TD;
        id0(start) --> id1{{Ask a question}}
        id1 -- Yes --> id2(A happy ending)
        id1 -- No --> id3(A sad ending)
    ```

    Click on an incorrect answer to see an example of another Explanation.
    </Explanation>
    <Explanation incorrectAnswer>
    This explanation will appear when any incorrect answer is selected as the `incorrectAnswer`.

    **Notes:**

    1. In fact, you don't need to supply `incorrectAnswer` for an incorrect-answer explanation but it
    is best practice to do so as some time in the future we may depend on that flag existing.  Currently,
    the code only tests for the existence of `correctAnswer` and defaults to an incorrect-answer
    explanation if `correctAnswer` doesn't exist.
    1. Unfortunately, you can't include admonitions in an Explanation.

    **Remember**
    Explanations are optional.  You don't need to include them, or you can include only one for a
    correct answer or incorrect answer - it's up to you.  If you don't include an Explanation then
    nothing is displayed when an (in)correct answer is clicked.
