## Introduction
Much like we can put different stuff in a bucket, like water or sand or fish (yum!),
we can also store different types of data in a variable.  Unlike a bucket, 
we tend to be a bit more picky about knowing what type of data we've stored
in our variables.  This is because we can do different things with different
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='datatype' plural />.  For example, we can do 
arithmetic on number data types but we can't on text (or 
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='string' />) data types.  Likewise, we can join
two strings together but doing that doesn't make too much sense with numbers.

:::note
Text is stored in what's called a <DisplayGlossaryItem item='string' /> data type.
It's called a 'string' because text is essentially a string of characters all joined together.

From now onwards we'll be referring to text only as **strings** and not as text.

We'll cover this further [below](TODO) but in coding, text includes spaces
(eg: 'Mark' is a string, as is 'Mark Ferraretto') and other special characters.
Just keep that in mind for now.

## Docassemble, Python and Data Types
In Docassemble, data types are used for two purposes.  When we look at the data
types of variables, we refer to *fundamental* data types.  These are types
such as text (strings), numbers (integers and floats) and <DisplayGlossaryItem item='boolean' plural />.
Fundamental data types are essential to Python, and so variables and code blocks.

Docassemble's [manual](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#data%20types)
refers to 'Data types and input types'.  Unhelpfully, Docassemble mixes the
two terms, but in Docassemble-speak most of its data types are actually 
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='intputtype' plural />.  Also unhelpfuly, we will 
also mix these terms!

#### The difference between a data type and an input type
A data type describes **the type of data**.  That is, the data may be a number,
or a string, or a picture, and so-on.  

An input type desribes **how the data is collected**. For example, Docassemble's
`radio` input type displays a question to a user as a set of radio buttons.  
However, what is stored in the variable is usually a string.

<details>
    <summary>
        Example of input and data types
    </summary>
This code block collects the salutation for a person.

```yml
---
mandatory: true
question: Salutation
subquestion: |
    We're just collecting a salutation and nothing else, for 
    demonstration purposes
fields:
    - Enter salutation: MJFsalutation
      input type: radio
      choices:
        - Dr
        - Mr
        - Mrs
        - Ms
        - Mx
---
```
Because the `input type` is `radio`, the choices are presented like this:

<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_03/datatypes1.png' />

You can see from the code block that the value will be stored in `MJFsalutation`.  However,
the data type of what is stored is *not* a `radio` data type. It is stored as a 
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='string' />.  This makes sense as what we're storing
is just text.

So, the *input type* is `radio` but the *data type* is string.

There are also *Docassemble data types*.  Docassemble data types are used by
docassemble to format how data is collected.  For example, Docassemble has
data types to display a question using [radio buttons](https://xx.xx)
