Simple and Complex data types

## Simple and Complex Data Types
Up until this point we have discussed 'simple' data types, that is data types that 
represent one thing - an integer, a floating point number, a string and so-on.
So far, we've only been storing one value in a variable.  However, like a bucket, it
is possible to store *more* than one thing in a variable at a time. For this we use
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='complexdatatype' plural />.

The complex data types we'll refer to in this textbook will be
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='list' plural /> and <DisplayGlossaryItem item='dictionary' plural />.
A list allows us to store multiple data and to access them, well, as a list ie:
from the first element to the last sequentially.  A dictionary allows us to refer
to data by an identifier, or a 'key'.  Both these data types unlock the ability for
us to store sophisticated data sets, even databases, in our Docassemble apps.

We will cover complex data types [later in this chapter](./00-40).
For now, it's worth being aware that complex data types exist.
