Now that we've learnt what variables are, what to store in them and how to test
them, how do we bring this all together?  How do we use variables 'in the real world'?

Docassemble has two ways for us to use variables.  One is in <DisplayGlossaryItem item='codeblock' plural />
and another is by using <DisplayGlossaryItem item='mako' upper />.

We will cover code blocks in this part of this chapter.  Mako is covered in the next part.

## Introducing Code Blocks
We are already familiar with the idea of **blocks**.  A block is some code that
is enclosed by `---` characters.  For example:
```yml
---
question: Title
subquestion: |
  This is a question block
---
```
So far we have worked with <DisplayGlossaryItem item='questionblock' plural />. As we know,
question blocks are used to display information to a user and to ask the user for information.
As we have also already discussed, we use Python to implement the decision-making part of our apps.
The way we tell Docassemble to carry out our decision-making logic is to place it into a code block.

Code blocks are blocks containing Python code.  Like question blocks, code blocks can also be
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='mandatory' />.  Also like question blocks, Docassemble will look for
a variable name inside a code block as part of its [execution order](/docs/textbook/chapter_02/00-20#execution-order).

Here's an example code block that sets the value of `MJFauthor` to `True` depending on what is in
the variable `MJFname`.
```python
---
code: |
  if MJFname == 'Mark Ferraretto' or MJFname == 'James Scheibner':
    MJFauthor = True
  else:
    MJFauthor = False
---
```
If our app was looking for the value of `MJFauthor` it would find this code block and execute it,
much like how Docassemble looks for a variable in a question block and executes that block.

## Writing good code blocks
There are two basic principles to be mindful of when writing code blocks.

### One variable one block
Firstly, you should only contain enough code to set *one* variable in a code block.  This means
that code blocks are usually short, maybe 10 lines or tens of lines.  If you find yourself writing
a 100-line code block that's probably a good indication you're doing too much work in one block.

For example, let's say we want to implement this logic flow:

<F1 />

We could do this in a single code block, however we shouldn't do this:
```python showLineNumbers
---
code: |
  # There are the chapters that Mark wrote
  # We assume that James wrote everything else
  marks_chapters = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7];
  
  # Check if MJFname is one of the authors
  if MJFname == 'Mark Ferraretto' or MJFname == 'James Scheibner':
    # Set MJFauthor to true if so
    MJFauthor = True
  else:
    # If we're here then MJFname is not an author
    MJFauthor = False
  
  # Now check the chapter numbers
  # If we're an author and we're Mark
  if MJFauthor and MJFname == 'Mark Ferraretto':
      # ... and the chapter is one of ours
      if MJFchapternumber in marks_chapters:
        # ...then set to true
        MJFchapter = True
      else:
        # ...otherwise set to false
        MJFchapter = False
  # Otherwise we might be an author and we're James
  elif MJFauthor and MJFname == 'James Scheibner':
    # We're here if we're James (ie: not Mark)
    # So, if we're James and the chapter is not one of Mark's...
    if MJFchapternumber not in marks_chapters:
      # ...then it must be one of James' chapters
      MJFchapter = True
    else:
      # ...otherwise, it's not
      MJFchapter = False
```
The most imortant reason for not coding this way is that the code blocks sets two 
variables: `MJFauthor` and `MJFchapter`.  This means the code block may be run twice
and, clearly, it makes for a rather hard to read code block.

:::note
This code block contains nested if statements which we discuss in <DisplayChapter chatper='chapter_04' />
and also uses a <DisplayGlossaryItem item='list' />, which is discussed in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_05'/>.

The comments should provide you with enough commentary to describe the code without you having to read
these other chapters, although you are welcome to do so if you wish.
:::

The better way to address this logic would be to break it out into two code blocks, one that sets
`MJFauthor`, one that sets `MJFchapter`.  For example, we would deal with `MJFauthor` in this
code block:
```python showLineNumbers
---
# A lovely, short easy to read code block
code: |
  # Check if MJFname is one of the authors
  if MJFname == 'Mark Ferraretto' or MJFname == 'James Scheibner':
    # Set MJFauthor to true if so
    MJFauthor = True
  else:
    # If we're here then MJFname is not an author
    MJFauthor = False
```
and then deal with `MJFchapter` in a separate block:
```python showLineNumbers
---
# Long but not as long as before.  And at
# least it deals with just one piece of logic
# (and it would be much shorter without these comments)
code: |
  # Our list of chapters as before
  marks_chapters = [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7]

  # If we're an author and we're Mark
  if MJFauthor and MJFname == 'Mark Ferraretto':
      # ... and the chapter is one of ours
      if MJFchapternumber in marks_chapters:
        # ...then set to true
        MJFchapter = True
      else:
        # ...otherwise set to false
        MJFchapter = False
  # Otherwise we might be an author and we're James
  elif MJFauthor and MJFname == 'James Scheibner':
    # We're here if we're James (ie: not Mark)
    # So, if we're James and the chapter is not one of Mark's...
    if MJFchapternumber not in marks_chapters:
      # ...then it must be one of James' chapters
      MJFchapter = True
    else:
      # ...otherwise, it's not
      MJFchapter = False
  # Catchall if, for example MJFauthor is false or
  # MJFname is not Mark or James.
  else:
    MJFchapter = False
---
```
This makes for clearer coding and for more efficient execution as, in our example, Docassemble doesn't
need to go to the trouble of determining `MJFchapter` when all it needs is the value of `MJFauthor`.

### Idempotence
[Idempotence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence) is a rather advanced IT concept that
is often encountered in declarative languages such as Docassemble.

:::info
See [this discussion](/docs/recipes/minimising_mandatory_blocks) on mandatory blocks and declarative sysystems.
:::

From our perspective this means two things:

Firstly, Docassemble may run our code block more than once 'behind the scenes' as it does what it needs to do
to get the information it means.

Secondly, because of this first point, we need to make sure that our code always yields the same result
regardless of how many times our code block is run.

Idempotence becomes an issue when we deal with complex data structures, particularly
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='list' plural />, as we discuss in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_05'/>.  It
usually becomes a problem when we add an item to a list.  For example this code block:
```python
---
code: |
  # Do some stuff
  # Do some more stuff
  an_item = something

  # Add an item to our list
  our_list.append(an_item)

  # Do some more stuff etc
```
We may expect this code block to run once only, but Docassemble may run it three or four times internally.
As a result `an_item` may get added to our list three or four times instead of the one time we expected.

We usually guard against this by initialising our lists at the beginning of the code block ie:
```python
---
code: |
  # Initialise our list
  our_list = [] # [] means an empty list

  # Do some stuff
  # Do some more stuff
  an_item = something

  # Add an item to our list
  our_list.append(an_item)

  # Do some more stuff etc
```
Now, each time this code block is run the list is initialised to an empty list, so we always know
where we're starting from.  as a result we'll always end up with only one `an_item` in our list.

Idempotence is rather complex and we don't need to go into it in more detail than this. For
practical purposes keep this in mind, especially when working with code blocks and lists.
