We covered variables briefly in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_02' target='00-20#line-6' /> but
let's go over them again in a bit more detail.

## What is a Variable?
A <DisplayGlossaryItem item='variable' /> is a place where you store stuff. 
It's called a 'variable' because you can store different stuff in ther each time.
We've already seen that we can run the same program many times, each time with
different values.

## Variables are like buckets
We've said this [before](../chapter_02/00-20#line-6) and we'll say it again.

A variable is kind of like a bucket.  You can put stuff in a bucket and you can
put stuff in a variable.

Variable|Bucket
---|---
Used to store stuff|Used to store stuff
Must have a name|Doesn't usually have a name
Can store (<DisplayGlossaryItem item='assign' />) stuff in it|Can store stuff in it




For example, we've been using `MJFfirstname` to store the first name in our
code in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_02' target='00-42' />. Each time
we run the program we're asked for our first name.  We can enter what we like
and each time we run the program we can enter something different if we want.
Each time we enter a first name into the app, what we enter is stored in `MJFfirstname`.

In Python-speak, what we store in a variable is called its **value**.  The term
'value' will be used a lot in this textbook.  

Let's have a look at the second question block in [this code](../chapter_02/00-42#our-code). It
looks like this:

```yml 
---
# My first Docassemble program
mandatory: True
question: Hello World!
...
---
question: Name
fields:
  - Salutation: MJFsalutation
    choices:
      - Dr
      - Mr
      - Mrs
      - Ms
  - First Name: MJFfirstname
  - Last Name: MJFlastname
---
``` 

You'll recall that this code displays this form:

<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_03/variables1.png' />

The second-last line of the code...
```yml
  # highlight-next-line
  - First Name: MJFfirstname
```
...tells Docassemble to display the 'First Name' field in the form. The user will
enter something into the 'First Name' text field.  When the user presses continue
Docassemble will store, or <DisplayGlossaryItem item='assign' /> the value the
user enters to the variable `MJFfirstname`.  Once that assignment is made, then
we can access what was assigned by calling `MJFfirstname`, as we do in line
24 of the same code:

```yaml 
---
# My first Docassemble program
mandatory: True
question: Hello World!
subquestion: |
...
  Column1|Column2
  -------|-------
  Salutation|${ MJFsalutation }
  # highlight-next-line
  First Name|${ MJFfirstname }
  Last Name|${ MJFlastname }
```

:::tip
We usually use <DisplayGlossaryItem item='questionblock' plural /> to display forms
and collect data and <DisplayGlossaryItem item='assign' /> that data into variables.

We will then access the data in variables to display information on a screen (by
using a <DisplayGlossaryItem item='subquestion' />).  We will also usually use
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='mako' upper /> in the subquestion tag to access those
variables.
