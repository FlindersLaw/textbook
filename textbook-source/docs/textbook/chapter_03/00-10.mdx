We covered variables briefly in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_02' target='00-20#line-6' /> but
let's go over them again in a bit more detail.

## What is a Variable?
A <DisplayGlossaryItem item='variable' /> is a place where you store stuff. 
It's called a 'variable' because you can store different stuff in ther each time.
We've already seen that we can run the same program many times, each time with
different values.

## Variables are like buckets
We've said this [before](../chapter_02/00-20#line-6) and we'll say it again.

A variable is kind of like a bucket.  You can put stuff in a bucket and you can
put stuff in a variable.

Variable|Bucket
---|---
Used to store stuff|Used to store stuff
Must have a name|Doesn't usually have a name
Can store (<DisplayGlossaryItem item='assign' />) stuff in it|Can store stuff in it

:::tip TODO
Nice to have a table with a picture of a variable and a picture of a bucket,
preferrably with the name of the variable written in the bucket and a 
'value' (eg:an image of the number 1) sticking out of it.

I've tried creating images in Dall-E but haven't gotten very far.
:::

For example, we've been using `MJFfirstname` to store the first name in our
code in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_02' target='00-42' />. Each time
we run the program we're asked for our first name.  We can enter what we like
and each time we run the program we can enter something different if we want.
Each time we enter a first name into the app, what we enter is stored in `MJFfirstname`.

In Python-speak, what we store in a variable is called its **value**.  The term
'value' will be used a lot in this textbook.  

Let's have a look at the second question block in [this code](../chapter_02/00-42#our-code). It
looks like this:

```yml 
---
# My first Docassemble program
mandatory: True
question: Hello World!
...
---
question: Name
fields:
  - Salutation: MJFsalutation
    choices:
      - Dr
      - Mr
      - Mrs
      - Ms
  - First Name: MJFfirstname
  - Last Name: MJFlastname
---
``` 

You'll recall that this code displays this form:

<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_03/variables1.png' />

The second-last line of the code...
```yml
  # highlight-next-line
  - First Name: MJFfirstname
```
...tells Docassemble to display the 'First Name' field in the form. The user will
enter something into the 'First Name' text field.  When the user presses continue
Docassemble will store, or <DisplayGlossaryItem item='assign' /> the value the
user enters to the variable `MJFfirstname`.  Once that assignment is made, then
we can access what was assigned by calling `MJFfirstname`, as we do in line
24 of the same code:

```yaml 
---
# My first Docassemble program
mandatory: True
question: Hello World!
subquestion: |
...
  Column1|Column2
  -------|-------
  Salutation|${ MJFsalutation }
  # highlight-next-line
  First Name|${ MJFfirstname }
  Last Name|${ MJFlastname }
```

:::tip
We usually use <DisplayGlossaryItem item='questionblock' plural /> to display forms
and collect data and <DisplayGlossaryItem item='assign' /> that data into variables.

We will then access the data in variables to display information on a screen (by
using a <DisplayGlossaryItem item='subquestion' />).  We will also usually use
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='mako' upper /> in the subquestion tag to access those
variables.
:::

## Terminology Recap
We've introduced lots of new concepts, so it's worth revisiting these.

### Variable
A variable is what we use to store data.  Much like how we put stuff in
a bucket, we can put stuff in a variable.

### Value
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='value' upper /> is another way of saying 'stuff', or data.  Data stored in a variable
is referred to as that variable's <DisplayGlossaryItem item='value' />.

#### Accessing a variable's value
To access a variable's value we
simply specify the variable's name.  For example, we're displaying the
value stored in each of `MJFsalutation`, `MJFfirstname` and `MJFlastname`
in this code from the subquestion block above:

```yml
  Column1|Column2
  -------|-------
  Salutation|${ MJFsalutation }
  First Name|${ MJFfirstname }
  Last Name|${ MJFlastname }
```

### Assignment
The process of putting a value into a variable is called **assignment**.  We
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='assign' /> a value to a variable.  We can
assign a value to a variable in two ways.

#### Asking the user a question
When we set up fields in a question block, the user is asked to input 
what values they think should go into one or more variables.  For example,
we use this question block to ask the user how they should be addressed, 
their first and their last name.

```yml
---
question: Name
fields:
    # highlight-next-line
  - Salutation: MJFsalutation
    choices:
      - Dr
      - Mr
      - Mrs
      - Ms
  // highlight-next-line
  - First Name: MJFfirstname
  // highlight-next-line
  - Last Name: MJFlastname
---
```

Docassemble displays this form:


<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_03/variables1.png' />

When the user presses <DisplayDAButtons button={da_continue_prop} /> 
Docassemble <DisplayGlossaryItem item='assign' plural /> the 
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='value' plural /> entered by the user into 
`MJFsalutation`, `MJFfirstname` and `MJFlastname` respectively.

#### Assignment in code blocks
As will be seen in <DisplayChapter chapter='TODO' /> it is also possible
to assign values to variables in <DisplayGlossaryItem item='codeblock' plural />.

For now, it's just worth being aware that you can also assign variables in 
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='python' /> code.  We use the equals sign (`=`) to
show that a value is being assigned to a variable.  For example:

```python
code: |
  MJFname = 'Mark Ferraretto'
```

:::note
Because `=` is used as an *assignment* variable we can't use it to test 
for equality.  That is, the above code block sets the value of `MJFname` to
be `Mark Ferraretto`.  It *is not* a test to see if the value in `MJFname`
*is equal to* `Mark Ferraretto`.  
To test that something equals something else we need to use the 'double-equals'
operator (`==`). 

Compare these examples:
```python
# Assigns 'Mark Ferraretto' to MJFname
code: |
  MJFname = 'Mark Ferraretto'
```
```python
# Tests to see if the value of MJFname is equal to Mark Ferraretto
code: |
  MJFname == 'Mark Ferraretto'
```

Be mindful of this as confusing `=` and `==` is a common mistake!


We will cover testing [further down in this chapter](./00-30).

  <Explanation correctAnswer>
  **Correct!**

  'Stuff' isn't really a technical way of describing what a variable contains
  (better to describe what's in a bucket!) although we're using it here.
  You can use 'data' as well but the term we're looking for is 
  <DisplayGlossaryItem item='value' />.
  
  Although we've used 'stuff' in this chapter we won't be using that term
  in the rest of the textbook.

<Quizlet title="Accessing and Setting Variables 2">
  Does this code assign a value to a variable or does this code display
  the value of a variable?

  ```yml

  This code assigns a value to `MJFname`
  </Answer>
  <Answer isCorrect>
  This code displays the value already assigned to `MJFname`
  </Answer>
  <Explanation correctAnswer>
  **Correct!**

  This code is using a <DisplayGlossaryItem item='subquestionblock' /> to
  display the value of `MJFname`.  

  The code snippet above won't run as there's no code to set `MJFname`.
  Try copying and pasting the complete code below into Docassemble to see
  how it works

  ```yml
