title: Code and Mako

import {DisplayChapter} from '@site/src/components';
import {DisplayGlossaryItem} from '@site/src/components';

We have already come across <DisplayGlossaryItem item='mako' upper /> in
<DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_02' />, where we used it to
[display the value of variables](/docs/textbook/chapter_02/00-42).  In 
<DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_04' /> we will see Mako used to
[embed decision-making logic](/docs/textbook/chapter_04/00-50) in our
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='questionblock' plural />.

What we want to draw out in this part of the chapter is the relationship between Mako
and <DisplayGlossaryItem item='python' upper />.  In short, we use Mako to embed
Python expressions into the 'display' parts of our app, such as question blocks.

## What is a Python Expression?
Python expressions are a [reasonably complex concept](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html).
However, we will limit ourselves to just this definition:

> A Python expression is Python code that can be evaluated to a single value.

For example, the Python expression `1 + 1` evaluates to `2`.  The expression `MJFname` evaluates
to whatever the value of `MJFname` is.  The expression `MJFfirstname + ' ' + MJFlastname` evaluates
to a [string](/docs/textbook/chapter_03/00-20#strings) containing the valueof `MJFfirstname`, then a space,
then the value of `MJFlastname` all joined together.

The key to all of these is that evaluate to a single 'thing' or a single value.

## Mako and Python Expressions
Mako takes any Python expression and evaluates it.  By embedding our expression in the `${...}`
enclosure we're telling Docassemble to fire up Mako for what's inside the braces, evaluate the
expression and then display the result.

We would call our above examples as follows:
```yml showLineNumbers
---
question: Mako demonstrator
subquestion: |
  What does 1 + 1 equal?  ${ 1 + 1 }

  The value of `MJFname` is ${MJFname}

  The full name is ${ MJFfirstname + ' ' + MJFlastname }
---
```

:::info Mako and spaces
You may have noticed that in some of our expressions we space things out
(eg: `${ 1 + 1 }` instead of `${1+1}`).  

Mako ignores spaces inside the braces, much like how Python also ignores 
spaces.  So, we can use spaces to, well, space things out (!) and make our
code easier to read.
:::

So, for example, this Mako:
```
  ${MJFname}
```

## Mako in Fields and Data Blocks
We have already used Mako in question blocks, but Mako can be used in many other
parts of Docassemble.  For example, it can be used in the question title:
```yml showLineNumbers
---
question: Hello ${MJFname}
subquestion: |
    This question block displays the value
    of `MJFname` in its title.
---
```
It can also be used in fields:
```yml showLineNumbers
---
question: Get last name
fields:
  - ${MJFfirstname}, what is your last name?: MJFlastname
---
```
Mako can also be used in the `subject` key of [template blocks](/docs/recipes/templates).

By a long way we will use Mako  in question blocks, but it is worth keeping in mind that
almost any part of Docassemble that contains string literals can also utilise Mako.

## Mako and Logic
In addition to displaying Python expressions, Mako has a second syntax which serves a
second function, namely logic.

We can use Mako to embed decision-making logic into our display text using the `%` 
syntax.  This `%` syntax applies only to two elements: `%if` for
[if statements](/docs/textbook/chapter_04/00-50) and `%for` for
[iteration](/docs/textbook/chapter_05/00-30#python-format-and-mako-format).

We will cover if statements in more detail in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_03' />
and iteration in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_05'/>.
