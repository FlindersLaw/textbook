In <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_02' /> you learnt how to write a Docassemble program
that asks questions and displays output.  In the next chapters
you will be taken through the coding concepts that will allow you make decisions
in your code and control the program flow.

In Docassemble we use <DisplayGlossaryItem item='python' /> as the coding language
for making decisions.  Python is actually one of the most popular programming
languages in the world. It's used a lot in AI and is also used by legal technology
firms, such as LexisNexis, in their practice management systems.  You can do an
awful lot with Python, and a complete study of Python is way beyond this textbook.
But Python is flexible enough that we can take just a bit of it and still
be useful.  That's what we'll be doing over the next few chapters.

In this chapter we'll take you through 
some of the foundations that you need to start programming in Python. The 
subsequent chapters will build on these foundations and you'll learn how 
to make decisions, display data and access data from databases.

In this chapter we will cover the following:

* First, we will start off by explaining how to store data in code, namely by 
using <DisplayGlossaryItem item='variable' plural />.
* Then we will talk about the different kinds of data we can store in variables.
These are called <DisplayGlossaryItem item='datatype' plural />.
* We will then discuss how to check, or 'test', data you have in your variable
to make sure it is what you think it is.
* We will discuss <DisplayGlossaryItem item='codeblock' plural />, which
is one of the ways we use to embed <DisplayGlossaryItem item='python' upper />.
* Finally, we will conclude by revisiting <DisplayGlossaryItem item='mako' upper />,
and demonstrate how Mako is actually a way of embedding bits of Python code, or
**[expressions](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html)** into
our Markdown, fields and other elements.

Away we go!
