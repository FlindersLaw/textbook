In <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_02' /> you learnt how to write a Docassemble program
that asks questions and displays output.  In the next chapters
you will be taken through the coding concepts that will allow you make decisions
in your code and control the program flow.

In Docassemble we use <DisplayGlossaryItem item='python' /> as the coding language
for making decisions.  Python is actually one of the most popular programming
languages in the world. It's used a lot in AI and is also used by legal technology
firms, such as LexisNexis, in their practice management systems.  You can do an
awful lot with Python, and a complete study of Python is way beyond this textbook.
But Python is flexible enough that we can take just a bit of it and still
be useful.  That's what we'll be doing over the next few chapters.

In this <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_03' /> we'll take you through 
some of the foundations that you need to start programming in Python. The 
subsequent chapters will build on these foundations and you'll learn how 
to make decisions, display data and access data from databases.

In this <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_03' /> we start off by explaining how we store data in code,
using <DisplayGlossaryItem item='variable' plural />, and we'll discuss the different kinds of 
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='datatype' plural />, such as text and numbers and so-on.  Finally, we'll cover the first part of decision-making logic: checking, or 'testing' 
a variable to make sure it contains what we think it does.

Away we go!
