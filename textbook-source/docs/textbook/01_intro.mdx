## What will we learn?
This textbook takes you through the skills you need to write a basic legal software application.
You will be writing on a platform called [Docassemble](https://docassemble.org).
Docassemble is an open-source platform that was written by a US public defender called
[Jonathan Pyle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-pyle-6800a75/)
to assist not-for-profit organisations with legal technology issues.  Docassemble allows us to write simple apps quickly.  It allows us to build apps pretty easily as it provides quick ways for us to construct:
* screens where we can ask users for information, or display information to them
* logic to help us make decisions
* document templates which we can customise for each user

It also provides other nice things, like allowing us to send emails and to make our apps look beautiful.

Docassemble is suitable for this course for two reasons:
  * It's a relatively simple platform to teach.  Yes, coding is scary but you don't need to learn too much to make a useful app in Docassemble
  * Because it's open source, the 'clients' we engage with can run the applications we write as they don't need to worry about licence fees.

## What will you learn in this book?
* First of all, in <DisplayChapter chapter="chapter_01" number /> we'll work through connecting you to our <DisplayConstants data={dahref} /> and
setting you up with <DisplayConstants data={github} /> which is what you will use to backup and share your code.
* In <DisplayChapter chapter="chapter_02" number /> you'll be introduced to Docassemble, learn how to write some basic apps, and be exposed to some of the fundamental concepts.
* In <DisplayChapter chapter="chapter_03" number  /> we learn about how to store data (in variales) and
about different types of data, such as text (or <DisplayGlossaryItem item='string' plural />), numbers
and <DisplayGlossaryItem item='boolean' plural />.
* In <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_04' number /> we'll start getting into how you write the logic you need to control your app.  For example we'll learn how to make decisions using 'if this then that' - or what's called 'branching' or <DisplayGlossaryItem item='ifstatement' plural />, 
* In <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_05' number /> we revisit data storage.  We learn how to store more complex 
data structures, such as lists and tables, and we're introduced to the concept of <DisplayGlossaryItem item='iteration' />
* <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_06' number /> contains a number of case studies which explain advanced
coding concepts. These case studies are based on code written by students and are a great reference for
more advanced coding.
* In <DisplayChapter chapter="chapter_07" number /> we look at how you can make your app look beautiful.  We'll cover things like adding your client's logo, using your client's colours and making your app look and feel nicer
* <DisplayChapter chapter="chapter_08" number /> covers creating document templates
* In <DisplayChapter chapter="chapter_09" number /> we discuss debugging your app, what error messages you're
* In <DisplayChapter chapter="chapter_10" number /> we discuss some of the principles to keep in mind when 
designing legal applications
* In <DisplayChapter chapter="chapter_11" number /> we discuss how you can collaborate with others
using <DisplayConstants data={github} />

## Conventions
### Literal text
In this textbook we will display some text in 
`fixed pitch font with this background`.  This kind of text is text that is 
either meant to be entered into your computer by you or is an extract of code
or data.

### Code snippets
We use code snippets extensively throughout this textbook to display code to you.  They usually
look like this:
```python
var1 = 'This is a short code snippet'
var2 = 'with only two lines of python code'
```

Larger snippests may include a file name and/or line numbers:
```yml title='Example code snippet' showLineNumbers
---
# Our first program!
mandatory: True
question: Hello World!
subquestion: |
  Hello,

  Welcome to Docassemble!
---
```
These snippets are used to display code to you that we will usually discuss in some detail in the textbook.

Code snippets with file names are line numbers are usually designed to be copied as a file into your Playground.

Usefully, the code snippets have a copy button built in.  Hover over the snippet with your mouse and you will
see a <DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/copy_button.png' inline /> button.  Click on this to copy the code 
in the snippet.

:::caution
When copying code from code snippets into your Playground please be mindful that there is some padding on the left
side of the snippet that **should** not be copied.  For example, this snippet with line numbers contains padding
after the line number that is not part of the code:

```yml showLineNumbers
---
# Our first program
mandatory: True
question: Hello World!
subquestion: |
  Hello!
---
```

When typing the code above, lines 1 to 5 and line 7 should start at the left margin of your
Playground editor and line 6 should be indented two spaces.  Here's an image of the same code in
the Playground editor:

<DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/intro01.png' caption='Code properly formatted' />

**Do not** place any leading spaces between the code and the left margin. This will lead to errors.

<DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/intro02.png' caption='INCORRECT. Do not start each line with a space' />
:::

Code snippets assume that code is positioned against the left margin.  

#### Syntax highlighting
Many code snippets use different colours to higlight syntax.  When you copy these snippets into your
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='playground' upper /> you might find the colours change.  This is not an issue.
Docasemble and this textbook use slightly different colouring schemes, and the colours themselves are not
part of the coding lanuage.

The colours are (meant to be) there to help you get syntax correct and nothing more.

### Coding exercises
There is a [Coding Exercises](/docs/coding_exercises) tab at the top of this textbook.  This tab contains,
unsurprisingly, a set of coding exercises.  These exercises are designed to build you coding skills and
form a good way of tackling this textbook generally.  Start with the first exercise, read the recommended
parts of the textbook then do the exercise.  Then move on to the next exercise and so-on.

Coding exercises are separated into groups, called 'Ex1', 'Ex2' and so-on.  The exercises in each group start
out at a basic level and each subsequent exercise builds on the previou one, teaching you ever more 
advanced skills.

We cannot emphasise how useful it is to use the Coding exercises to work your way through this textbook.
Start with the first exercise, read the recommended
parts of the textbook then do the exercise.  Then move on to the next exercise and so-on.

:::note
Depending on the topic(s) in which this textbook is used, some coding exercises may form part of 
students' assessments.

### Quizlets
Interspersed throughout this textbook are short quizzes designed as a quick touchpoint for readers.  These
are called 'Quizlets'.  Quizlets present a question with multiple choice answers. When you click on an
answer some text will be displayed at the bottom of the Quizlet.  Try the example quizlet below.

<Quizlet>
  <DisplayConstants data={dahref} text="Docassemble" /> is an open-source system
  written by a US public defender called Jonathan Pyle to assist not-for-profit
  organisations with legal technology issues.
  <Answer isCorrect>
  True
  </Answer>
  <Answer>
  False
  </Answer>
</Quizlet>
  
## Learning resources
There are a number of learning resources available to you in addition to this textbook.
We will refer to some throughout the textbook but you should be aware of the usefulness
of others also.

### Docassemble manual
This is the official [manual](https://docassemble.org/docs) for Docassemble and is a must-have
reource.  The manual is written for readers with limited coding skills.  At the same time
it is a comprehensive explanation of Docassemble's capabilities.  It covers a lot more
than what is covered in this textbook and it explains in more detail what is covered
in this textbook.

As much as possible this textbook tries not to duplicate what is in the Docassemble manual.
That is, if we are discussing a concept that is documented in the manual we will just refer
you directly to the manual instead of repeating the explanation here.

### Docassemble Slack
[Slack](https://slack.com) is a collaboration tool, much like Microsoft Teams or Discord.  The
Docassemble community has established its own Slack community at
https://docassemble.slack.com.

Students are strongly encouraged to join this Slack community.  There is a special
`#student-questions` channel which, unfortunately, is woefully under-utilised.  The community is
small but very responsive and very helpful.

Students are encouraged to register with their Flinders email addresses so they are more easily
identified as students on the community.

:::note
You need to be invited to join the Slack community.  An invite link will be published in Canvas as one 
of your topic resources.

### Generative AI
At the time of writing (early 2024) the authors found that AI tools, such as [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com)
and [Google Bard](https://bard.google.com) are not particuarly good at generating Docassemble code.  In fact
they are pretty atrocious!  The is probably due to the small amount of Docassemble code publicly available
to be scraped off the internet.

AI systems, however, are very useful for generating <DisplayGlossaryItem item='css' /> and
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='python' upper /> code.

:::caution
AI systems should only be used if your topic allows it and such usage should always be clearly 
documented.

Students using AI systems are encouraged to keep a log of prompts and output supplied to and
received from AI systems.
