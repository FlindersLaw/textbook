## What are we doing?

Now it is my turn to introduce you to the topic!
As you first enrol in this topic and look at the assessments, you are probably asking yourself why we teach you how to code. You might be left thinking that this topic is about teaching you how to become software developers. However, what this topic is really about is getting you to think about **access to justice** differently. 

What do we mean by access to justice? In the Australian legal system, everyone has the right to access justice. In other topics in your law degree, you will learn about how to construct an argument for your client before a court. However, just because everyone has the right to access justice does not mean that this right is easy to exercise in practice. In 2018, the Law Council of Australia conducted a review of the barriers limiting access to justice. 

## Why do we teach you coding?

* But if you understand the basic coding concepts you learn during this topic you'll be able to apply them to almost any technology
* Many law practices have tech platforms that they pay for but never use fully, such as practice mgmt systems and even MS 365
* Many law practices PMS' have document automation components.  Most lawyers don't know how to use them. The aim of this course is to give you a leg-up on getting more comfortable with that tech and make you more useful as law grads.

## What will we learn?

* You're going to learn how to write a basic legal software application
* We'll be using a platform called [Docassemble](https://docassemble.org).  Docassemble is an open-source platform that was written by a US lawyer called [Jonathan Pyle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-pyle-6800a75?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_contact_details%3B7%2FdkCCVJQIaHtoVPV7v9og%3D%3D) to assist not-for-profits with legal tech issues.  
* Docassemble allows us to write simple apps quickly.  It allows us to build apps pretty easily as it provides quick ways for us to construct:
  * screens where we can ask users for information, or display information to them
  * logic to help us make decisions
  * document templates which we can customise for each user
* It also provides other nice things, like allowing us to send emails and to make our apps look beautiful.
* Docassemble is suitable for this course for two reasons:
  * It's a relatively simple platform to teach (!).  Yes, coding is scary but you don't need to learn too much to make a useful app in Docassemble
  * Because it's open source, the 'clients' we engage with can run the applications we write as they don't need to worry about licence fees.

## What does this book teach me?

* First of all, in <DisplayChapter chapter="1" /> we'll work through connecting you to our <DisplayConstants data="dahref" /> and setting you up with <DisplayConstants data='github' /> which isk what we'll to share our code.
* In <DisplayChapter chapter="2" /> you'll be introduced to Docassemble and learn how to write some basic apps.
* In <DisplayChapter chapter="3" /> we'll start getting into how you write the logic you need to control your app.  For example we'll learn how to make decisions using 'if this then that' - or what's called 'branching' or 'if statements', and you'll also learn about processing lists of data - which is called 'iteration'.
* In <DisplayChapter chapter="4" /> we'll learn about <DisplayConstants data='github' />. We'll use GitHub to collaborate on our projects in small groups.  GitHub allows a group to work on code at the same time.
* In <DisplayChapter chapter="5" /> we'll look at how you can make your app look beautiful.  We'll cover things like adding your client's logo, using your client's colours and making your app look and feel nicer
* In <DisplayChapter chapter="6" /> we'll cover more advanced coding concepts, such as complex data structures, grouping and sending emails.

## What else should go in here?
Before you work your way through this textbook, there are a few things to bear in mind. 

First, learning how to code is **tough** and has a steep learning curve. Therefore, we spend the first six weeks working with you intensively on how to code.

What about the coding exercises?

Anything about code vs no-code?
