## What are we doing?

* We are teaching you coding skills
* Aim is to expose you to technology and how it interoperates with the law

## Why do we teach you coding?

* We're not training you to beome software developers
* But if you understand the basic coding concepts you learn during this topic you'll be able to apply them to almost any technology
* Many law practices have tech platforms that they pay for but never use fully, such as practice mgmt systems and even MS 365
* Many law practices PMS' have document automation components.  Most lawyers don't know how to use them. The aim of this course is to give you a leg-up on getting more comfortable with that tech and make you more useful as law grads.

## What will we learn?

* You're going to learn how to write a basic legal software application
* We'll be using a platform called [Docassemble](https://docassemble.org).  Docassemble is an open-source platform that was written by a US lawyer called [Jonathan Pyle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-pyle-6800a75?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_contact_details%3B7%2FdkCCVJQIaHtoVPV7v9og%3D%3D) to assist not-for-profits with legal tech issues.  
* Docassemble allows us to write simple apps quickly.  It allows us to build apps pretty easily as it provides quick ways for us to construct:
  * screens where we can ask users for information, or display information to them
  * logic to help us make decisions
  * document templates which we can customise for each user
* It also provides other nice things, like allowing us to send emails and to make our apps look beautiful.
* Docassemble is suitable for this course for two reasons:
  * It's a relatively simple platform to teach (!).  Yes, coding is scary but you don't need to learn too much to make a useful app in Docassemble
  * Because it's open source, the 'clients' we engage with can run the applications we write as they don't need to worry about licence fees.

## What does this book teach me?

* First of all, in <DisplayChapter chapter="1" /> we'll work through connecting you to our <DisplayConstants data="dahref" /> and setting you up with <DisplayConstants data='github' /> which isk what we'll to share our code.
* In <DisplayChapter chapter="2" /> you'll be introduced to Docassemble and learn how to write some basic apps.
* In <DisplayChapter chapter="3" /> we'll start getting into how you write the logic you need to control your app.  For example we'll learn how to make decisions using 'if this then that' - or what's called 'branching' or 'if statements', and you'll also learn about processing lists of data - which is called 'iteration'.
* In <DisplayChapter chapter="4" /> we'll learn about <DisplayConstants data='github' />. We'll use GitHub to collaborate on our projects in small groups.  GitHub allows a group to work on code at the same time.
* In <DisplayChapter chapter="5" /> we'll look at how you can make your app look beautiful.  We'll cover things like adding your client's logo, using your client's colours and making your app look and feel nicer
* In <DisplayChapter chapter="6" /> we'll cover more advanced coding concepts, such as complex data structures, grouping and sending emails.
