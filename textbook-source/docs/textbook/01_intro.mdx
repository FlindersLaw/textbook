## What are we doing?

Now it is my turn to introduce you to the topic!
As you first enrol in this topic and look at the assessments, you are probably asking yourself why we teach you how to code. You might be left thinking that this topic is about teaching you how to become software developers. However, what this topic is really about is getting you to think about **access to justice** differently. 

What do we mean by access to justice? In the Australian legal system, everyone has the right to access justice. In other topics in your law degree, you will learn about how to construct an argument for your client before a court. However, just because everyone has the right to access justice does not mean that this right is easy to exercise in practice. In 2018, the Law Council of Australia conducted a [review](https://www.lawcouncil.asn.au/justice-project/final-report) of the social and economic barriers limiting access to justice. The Law Council's report notes that disadvantage can be a trigger for legal problems, with people experiencing multiple layers of disavantage more likely to experience complex legal problems. In addition, financial disadvantage and poverty can be a significant barrier to accessing a lawyer. In Australia, legal aid grants are available to people who cannot otherwise afford lawyers. However, only eight perecent of the Australian population can access legal aid, despite the fact that forteen percent of Australians live below the poverty line. Likewise, government funded community legal centres play a key role in helping provide free legal advice to the community. Unfortunately because these community legal centres have limited resources, it is estimated that at least [170,000 Australians](http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/PrecedentAULA/2019/53.html#fn2) are turned away from free legal services every year. 

To help overcome these barriers, the Law Council's report [recommended](https://lawcouncil.au/files/web-pdf/Justice%20Project/Final%20Report/03%20-%202018%2009%20-%20Recommendations%20and%20Group%20Priorities.pdf) exploring the potential benefits that technology can bring. It is important to recognise that technology is not going to immediately solve the access to justice gap in Australia. The Law Council's report warns that certain disadvantaged groups who are digitally excluded and could be left behind without due care. However, the Law Council's report also highlights how online self-help tools can provide individuals with sufficient capacity to resolve their own issues. Many of the applications that our students have developed for this course can make a difference right away in helping people solve their legal problems. Legal technology can also help refer people to the most appropriate service to help solve their problems, as well as help people fill out forms. All of these applications can make a real difference to help people access justice, 24/7. Also, by completing this topic you get an insight into real socio-legal issues that few other law topics give you.

## Why do we teach you coding?

We do not expect you to leave this topic as a software engineer (unless you want to retrain as a software engineer). However, if you understand the basic coding concepts you learn during this topic you'll be able to apply them to almost any technology. My introduction to legal informatics involved learning to code precedents, or automated documents, using a practice management platform at a law firm. For example, you might use a precedent to automatically generate a contract for the sale of a client's business. 

Unfortunately, very few lawyers or paralegals have the time to learn how to code and then actually code these precedents. However, the code that we teach you in this topic is very similar to the code that you might use for a precedent. Therefore, by completing this topic you will have an immediate advantage relative to your peers. In addition, we teach you how to use word processing software and productivity suites, such as Microsoft Office 365. Although you might be very familiar with these tools from your other topics, they have some powerful features which can help you when preparing legal documents.

## What will we learn?

In this topic, you will learn how to write a basic legal software application. We'll be using a platform called [Docassemble](https://docassemble.org). Docassemble is an open-source platform that was written by a US public defender called [Jonathan Pyle](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-pyle-6800a75?lipi=urn%3Ali%3Apage%3Ad_flagship3_profile_view_base_contact_details%3B7%2FdkCCVJQIaHtoVPV7v9og%3D%3D) to assist not-for-profits with legal tech issues.  Docassemble allows us to write simple apps quickly.  It allows us to build apps pretty easily as it provides quick ways for us to construct:
  * screens where we can ask users for information, or display information to them
  * logic to help us make decisions
  * document templates which we can customise for each user
It also provides other nice things, like allowing us to send emails and to make our apps look beautiful.

Docassemble is suitable for this course for two reasons:
  * It's a relatively simple platform to teach.  Yes, coding is scary but you don't need to learn too much to make a useful app in Docassemble
  * Because it's open source, the 'clients' we engage with can run the applications we write as they don't need to worry about licence fees.

## What will you learn in this book?

* First of all, in <DisplayChapter chapter="1" /> we'll work through connecting you to our <DisplayConstants data="dahref" /> and setting you up with <DisplayConstants data='github' /> which is what we'll to share our code.
* In <DisplayChapter chapter="2" /> you'll be introduced to Docassemble and learn how to write some basic apps.
* In <DisplayChapter chapter="3" /> we'll start getting into how you write the logic you need to control your app.  For example we'll learn how to make decisions using 'if this then that' - or what's called 'branching' or 'if statements', and you'll also learn about processing lists of data - which is called 'iteration'.
* In <DisplayChapter chapter="4" /> we'll learn about <DisplayConstants data='github' />. We'll use GitHub to collaborate on our projects in small groups.  GitHub allows a group to work on code at the same time.
* In <DisplayChapter chapter="5" /> we'll look at how you can make your app look beautiful.  We'll cover things like adding your client's logo, using your client's colours and making your app look and feel nicer
* In <DisplayChapter chapter="6" /> we'll cover more advanced coding concepts, such as complex data structures, grouping and sending emails.

## Learning to Code
Before you work your way through this textbook, there are a few things to bear in mind. 

Learning how to code has a steep learning curve. Therefore, we spend the first six weeks working with you intensively on how to code. We do this via a series of hybrid coding workshops. We will work through an exercise with you step by step, where we will code a bit and then you will follow what we have done. Then you will need to extend out the code you have written for your individual assessment.

This dovetails into the next point, which is that we strongly recommend that you work your way through all of the coding exercises. We do not recommend that you just limit yourself to your individual assessments. There are a few reasons for that. First, you will get better at coding the more you code! Second, these exercises will directly help you learn how to complete the individual assessment. Second, most of your assessment for this topic depends on the application you write for your client. However, there is nothing to stop you reusing code from this textbook in your application. 

Finally, we prefer to teach you how to code using a code-based platform rather than a no-code platform. Although no-code platforms are easier to work with, you do not learn as much about how the application works. Therefore, learning some basic coding helps build your understanding of technology!
