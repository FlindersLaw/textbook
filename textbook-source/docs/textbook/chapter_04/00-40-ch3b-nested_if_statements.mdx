## Nested If statements
If statements aren't usually used in isolation, much like decisions aren't made in isolation.
Usually we make a set of decisions to arrive at a conclusion.  For example,

> Something like the dog legislation?  Or maybe there's something we can take from the C5 videos?

- Discuss how we express this code by having an if statement inside another if statement (show an example, or an example of the above code would be great).
- These are called **nested if statements** 
:::note
not a glossary term. Should it be?
:::
- In practice you will use many nested if statements precisely because you'll 
need to make many decisions, one after the other.
:::tip todo
quizzes or exercises exploring nested if statements. Maybe match the if statement to a flowchart?
