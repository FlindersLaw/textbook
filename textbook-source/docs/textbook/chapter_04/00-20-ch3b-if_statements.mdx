## An introduction to Logic
In this chapter, we will talk about logic and how to control the logic of our applications. We can use logic to make our app can do one thing or another depending on the input it receives. We can direct the flow of the program depending on how the user inputs certain information. We will do this using if statements.

For example, you might want your app to perform a set of initial eligibility checks before proceeding with your main analysis. You might want to check for age or residency, because your app only applies to adults who are not pensioners or South Australian residents. These kinds of preliminary questions are good to resolve early in your processing flow. Otherwise, your user might have to run through the whole app to find out they should have never run it in the first place! Therefore, we can ask the user a few preliminary questions and, based on those questions, decide which path the application should take. 

For a simple application, we can use logic and just one question to direct the flow of our application.
```mermaid
flowchart LR;
    id1{{Are you over 18?}} -- Yes --> id2(You are an adult.)
    id1 -- No --> id3(You are a minor)
```
More complex decisions might have many different answers.  For example, when deciding on the closest court in the Adelaide region, we might want to ask our user a question with multiple options.
```mermaid
flowchart LR;
    id1{{Where do you live?}}
    id1 -- West Adelaide --> id2(Port Adelaide Magistrates Court)
    id1 -- Northern Adelaide --> id3(Elizabeth Magistrates Court)
    id1 -- North-East Adelaide --> id4(Adelaide Magistrates Court)
    id1 -- Adelaide CBD --> id4
    id1 -- Southern Adelaide --> id5(Christies Beach Magistrates Court)
```

Therefore, the questions that we ask will influence how we structure our decision making processes.

Is there a way to centralise the flowchart styles instead of copying them into
every single flowchart manually?

Is there a way to automatically assign, for example the `{{...}}` elements in the 
flowchart the appropriate style automatically?

## Express logic in code - If statements
We need a way to express this decision-making process in code.  To do so we use  <DisplayGlossaryItem item='ifstatement' plural />.

An if statement tells a program to do something if a certain condition is met. This is the simplest type of if statement. We might express this the following way in pseudocode:

**IF** *user is over 18* **THEN** *they are an adult*

A more complex if statement might tell a program to do something if a condition is met, and something else if that condition is not met. This is known as an if-else statement.

**IF** *user is over 18* **THEN** *they are an adult* **ELSE** *they are a child*

There are also multiple ways that we could evaluate whether the user is over 18. 

Then we go into if statements.  

Review C2.01.  From memory I think we had these shortcomings.
- we need to cover it a bit more slowly.  Introduce if, then if/else, then if/elif.  Maybe have mini-quizzes after each one?
    - we want quite a few examples under here.
    - If/else will be used the most - it's for Yes/No answers
        - point back to the 'Yes/No' discussion we had in ch3a
    - If/elif is used when there's more than one answer
        - maybe show some simple ones (like the example above) but then go into some more complex ones
- Relate back to testing.  If statments basically test if something is true.  So, if age is over 18 would be to test the mathematical expression `age >= 18` is true.
- If we want to test something is false we need to
    1. either use the `else` part of the statement; or
    2. express our test so that it returns true.  For example if we want to test if someone is **not** over 18, then we re-express that test as someone being **under** 18 (`age < 18`)

## Nested If statements
If statements aren't usually used in isolation, much like decisions aren't made in isolation.
Usually we make a set of decisions to arrive at a conclusion.  For example,

> Something like the dog legislation?  Or maybe there's something we can take from the C5 videos?

- Discuss how we express this code by having an if statement inside another if statement (show an example, or an example of the above code would be great).
- These are called **nested if statements** 
:::note
not a glossary term. Should it be?
:::
- In practice you will use many nested if statements precisely because you'll 
need to make many decisions, one after the other.
:::tip todo
quizzes or exercises exploring nested if statements. Maybe match the if statement to a flowchart?
:::

## Testing many things at once
- sometimes may need to check more than one thing at a time before move on eg:
```mermaid
flowchart LR;
    id1{{are you 18 and female?}}
    id1 -- Yes --> id2(...)
    id1 -- No --> id3(...)
```

Explain thahis as an `if a == xx and b == yy`
- expand into multiple ands?

Explain that this way is better when you know the result of both (or all) the 
testing variables at once.  If you don't know all the results, then use nested if statements.

## More complex examples
And maybe we transpose the C5 videos into here?

## Mako if
Probably need to introduce this earlier?

- express if statements in subquestion blocks so can control display output
    - show an example
- emphasise the distinction between Mako and code block if statements
- emphasise can't indent Mako ifs
    - and need a `% endif`
