title: "Ch 3b: Mako if statements"
---

## Mako if
Probably need to introduce this earlier?

- express if statements in subquestion blocks so can control display output
    - show an example
- emphasise the distinction between Mako and code block if statements
- emphasise can't indent Mako ifs
    - and need a `% endif`
