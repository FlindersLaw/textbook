## Testing For More Than One Condition
Our basic if-else block works well if we just have two options. What happens if we have more than one option? For example:

* If a person is charged with driving under the influence, there might be different penalties depending on how many times they have been caught
* If a person has been diagnosed with a disability, they might be entitled to different levels of support depending on the level of their disability
* We might want to direct our user to multiple endpoints depending on their circumstances.

We can implement this kind of logic in one of two ways:

* With elif statements; and,
* With nested if statements

In this section, we will explain how to use elif statements.

## An 'Elif' Statement
'Elif' stands for 'Else If'. They allow us to add in conditions for our application if the first if statement condition is not met. 

### Elif Statement Rules

In addition to the rules for using if statements, elif statements:

* Must come after an if statement;
* Must have a space between the elif and the statement

As for an if statement, you do not need to conclude an if-elif statement with an ```else``` clause. If you are using an if-elif statement to evaluate the user's input from a radio buttons option, you should be able to define an ```if``` and ```elif``` statement for each option. However, as a general rule it is safest to end your if-elif statement with an else clause. Let's see how we might implement an example in code.

## Using Elif Statements
Consider the following scenario. We have been contracted by a community legal centre, Adelaide Community Legal Centre, to develop an app that can help people determine whether they are eligible for different forms of welfare. Specifically:

* If the user is younger than 18, they might be eligible for Family Tax A and B;
* Else, if the user is 65 or older, they might be eligible for the aged pension;
* Else, they need to come talk to ACLC (they may be eligible for AusStudy or something similar)

This example is a simplified version of how the Australian welfare system works. If you are in fact working on a problem for a real client, you will need to make sure that your analysis of the law is correct!

We would first map out the following logic with a flow chart.

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
    id1{{How old are you?}}
    id1 -- 18 or younger --> id2(Family Tax A or B)
    id1 -- 65 or older --> id3(Aged Care Pension)
    id1 -- Between 18 and 65  --> id4(Make an Appointment)
```

This flow chart tells us we need the following:

* We need one question that will ask for the user's age.
* We will then need three endpoints, using event tags, that will redirect the user depending on what answers they have entered

Let's go ahead and implement that:

```yaml showLineNumbers title="Ch4_Age_Eligibility_Elif.yml" showLineNumbers

question: |
  What is your age?
fields:
  - no label: userAge
    datatype: integer

mandatory: True 
code: |
  if userAge < 18:
    familyTaxAB
  elif userAge >= 65:
    agedPension
  else:
    contactUs

# This is the endpoint for familyTaxAB
event: familyTaxAB

  Thank you for completing this questionnaire

  Because you are under 18, your parents may be eligible for [Family Tax A and B](https://www.dss.gov.au/families-and-children/benefits-payments/family-tax-benefit)

```

Now let's break down this code.

### Lines 8 to 15
Our application has only one ```mandatory``` code block, starting at line 8. Docassemble will therefore execute this code block first. To evaluate the if statement starting at line 10, Docassemble will need a value for ```userAge```.

### Lines 1 to 7
To assign a value for ```userAge```, Docassemble will then fire the question starting on Line 1. Docassemble then returns to the if statement in the ```mandatory``` code block. 

If ```userAge``` is less than 18, the event on Line 18, ```familyTaxAB```, is triggered.

Else (that is, if ```userAge``` is *not* less than 18), if ```userAge``` is more than 65, the event on Line 31, ```agedPension```, is triggered. 

Else (that is, if neither of the two conditions above are met), then the event on Line 44, ```contactUs```, is triggered.
