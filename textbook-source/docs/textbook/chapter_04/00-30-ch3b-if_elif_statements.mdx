## Testing For More Than One Condition
Our basic if-else block works well if we just have two options. What happens if we have more than one option? For example:

* If a person is charged with driving under the influence, there might be different penalties depending on how many times they have been caught
* If a person has been diagnosed with a disability, they might be entitled to different levels of support depending on the level of their disability
* We might want to direct our user to multiple endpoints depending on their circumstances.

We can implement this kind of logic in one of two ways:

* With elif statements; and,
* With nested if statements

In this section, we will explain how to use elif statements.

## An 'Elif' Statement
'Elif' stands for 'Else If'. They allow us to add in conditions for our application if the first if statement condition is not met. 

### Elif Statement Rules
In addition to the rules for using if statements, elif statements:

* Must come after an if statement;
* Must have a space between the elif and the statement

As for an if statement, you do not need to conclude an if-elif statement with an ```else``` clause. If you are using an if-elif statement to evaluate the user's input from a radio buttons option, you should be able to define an ```if``` and ```elif``` statement for each option. However, as a general rule it is safest to end your if-elif statement with an else clause. Let's see how we might implement an example in code.

## Using Elif Statements
Consider the following scenario. We have been contracted by a community legal centre, Adelaide Community Legal Centre, to develop an app that can help people determine whether they are eligible for different forms of welfare. Specifically:

* If the user is younger than 18, they might be eligible for Family Tax A and B;
* Else, if the user is 65 or older, they might be eligible for the aged pension;
* Else, they need to come talk to ACLC (they may be eligible for AusStudy or something similar)

This example is a simplified version of how the Australian welfare system works. If you are in fact working on a problem for a real client, you will need to make sure that your analysis of the law is correct!
:::

We would first map out the following logic with a flow chart.

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
    id1{{How old are you?}}
    id1 -- 18 or younger --> id2(Family Tax A or B)
    id1 -- 65 or older --> id3(Aged Care Pension)
    id1 -- Between 18 and 65  --> id4(Make an Appointment)
```

This flow chart tells us we need the following:

* We need one question that will ask for the user's age.
* We will then need three endpoints, using event tags, that will redirect the user depending on what answers they have entered

Let's go ahead and implement that:

```yaml showLineNumbers title="Ch4_Welfare_Elif.yml" showLineNumbers
---
question: |
  What is your age?
fields:
  - no label: userAge
    datatype: integer
---
mandatory: True 
code: |
  if userAge < 18:
    familyTaxAB
  elif userAge >= 65:
    agedPension
  else:
    contactUs
---
# This is the endpoint for familyTaxAB
event: familyTaxAB

```

Now let's break down this code.

### Lines 8 to 15
Our application has only one ```mandatory``` code block, starting at line 8. Docassemble will therefore execute this code block first. To evaluate the if statement starting at line 10, Docassemble will need a value for ```userAge```.

### Lines 1 to 7
To assign a value for ```userAge```, Docassemble will then fire the question starting on Line 1. Docassemble then returns to the if statement in the ```mandatory``` code block. 

If ```userAge``` is less than 18, the event on Line 18, ```familyTaxAB```, is triggered.

<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_04/family_tax_ab_elif_statement.png' altText='The endpoint displayed if the user says they are under 18' />

Else (that is, if ```userAge``` is *not* less than 18), if ```userAge``` is more than 65, the event on Line 31, ```agedPension```, is triggered. 

<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_04/aged_pension_elif_statement.png' altText='The endpoint displayed if the user says they are 65 or older' />

Else (that is, if neither of the two conditions above are met), then the event on Line 44, ```contactUs```, is triggered.

<Quizlet title="If-Elif Statement Quiz">
  Which of the following is **not** true about `elif` clauses?
  <Answer>
  An `elif` clause must follow an initial `if` statement clause
  </Answer>
  <Answer>
  An `elif` statement must be concluded with an `:`
  </Answer>
  <Answer isCorrect>
  An `elif` statement must be followed by an `else` statement.
  </Answer>
  <Explanation correctAnswer>
  That's right. We can only use an `elif` statement clause once we have used an `if` statement clause. We also need to conclude the `elif` statement clause with a `:` once we have included the condition. We can also include as many `elif` clauses as we want after an `if` statement clause.
  </Explanation>
  <Explanation>
  That's not quite right. Remember that we can use an `elif` statement clause in an `if` statement once we have defined the initial `if` statement clause. We must also terminate the `elif` statement clause with a `:`. Remember that we do not need to terminate an `if` statement clause with an `else` - we can define each case using an `elif` if we wish.
  </Explanation>

## Another If-Elif Statement Example
You might recall this flowchart from the section on if statements:

```mermaid
flowchart LR;
    id1{{Where do you live?}}
    id1 -- West Adelaide --> id2(Port Adelaide Magistrates Court)
    id1 -- Northern Adelaide --> id3(Elizabeth Magistrates Court)
    id1 -- North-East Adelaide --> id4(Adelaide Magistrates Court)
    id1 -- Adelaide CBD --> id4
    id1 -- Southern Adelaide --> id5(Christies Beach Magistrates Court)
```

From this flowchart, our Docassemble application will need three blocks:

* A question block which asks the user where they live
* A code block which determines which court the user will go to
* An endpoint which displays this to the user

Let's see how we can implement this code in Docassemble

```yaml showLineNumbers title="Ch4_Magistrates_Court_Tool.yml" showLineNumbers
---
question: |
  Where do you live?
fields:
  - no label: userLocation
    datatype: radio
    choices:
      - Western Adelaide: west
      - Northern Adelaide: north
      - North-East Adelaide: northeast
      - Adelaide CBD: cbd
      - Southern Adelaide: south
      - None of the above: none
---
mandatory: True 
code: |
  if userLocation == 'west':
    userCourt = 'Port Adelaide Magistrates Court'
    courtAddress = '260 St Vincent St, Port Adelaide SA 5015'
    courtEndscreen
  elif userLocation == 'north':
    userCourt = 'Elizabeth Magistrates Court'
    courtAddress = '15 Frobisher Road, Elizabeth SA 5112'
    courtEndscreen
  elif userLocation == 'northeast':
    userCourt = 'Adelaide Magistrates Court'
    courtAddress = '260 Victoria Square, Adelaide SA 5000'
    courtEndscreen
  elif userLocation == 'cbd':
    userCourt = 'Adelaide Magistrates Court'
    courtAddress = '260 Victoria Square, Adelaide SA 5000'
    courtEndscreen
  elif userLocation == 'south':
    userCourt = 'Christies Beach Magistrates Court'
    courtAddress = '96 Dyson Road, Christie Downs SA 5164'
    courtEndscreen
  else:
    noCourtEndscreen
---
# This is the endpoint for if the user is in range of a Magistrates court
event: courtEndscreen
question: Your local Magistrates Court
subquestion: |
  Thank you for completing this survey.

  Your nearest Magistrates Court is ${userCourt} at ${courtAddress}.

# This is the endpoint for if the user is not in range of a Magistrates court

subquestion: |
  Thank you for completing this survey.

  There is no suburban Magistrates Court near you.

buttons:
  - Restart: restart
  - Exit: exit

```

Now, let's consider how this code will run. 

### Lines 15 to 38
Docassemble will first execute the mandatory code block that starts on Line 15. To evaluate this code block, it needs a value for ```userLocation```.

### Lines 1 to 14
To obtain a value for ```userLocation```, Docassemble will then need to execute the question block starting on Line 2. This will display a radio options screen to the user.

<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_04/magistrates_court_radio_options_elif_statement.png' altText='The radio options screen which allows to select where they live, so Docassemble can display which Magistrates Court in Adelaide they are closest to' />

### Lines 54 to 65
If the user selects **None of the above**, Docassemble will redirect the user to the ```noCourtEndscreen```. 

<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_04/no_magistrates_court_endpoint_elif_statement.png' altText='The endpoint screen displayed to the user if they select "None of the above" from the previous screen' />

### Lines 40 to 53
Otherwise, Docassemble will redirect the user to the ```courtEndscreen```. The if-elif block on Lines 17 to 36 will set the value for ```userCourt``` and ```courtAddress```. For example, let's say our user selects **Western Adelaide**. The following screen will be displayed.

<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_04/port_magistrates_court_endpoint_elif_statement.png' altText='The endpoint screen displayed to the user if they select "Western Adelaide" on the previous screen' />

<Quizlet title="If-Elif Statement Quiz">
  Consider the following `if-elif` statement:

  ```yaml
  ---
  question: |
    What is your age?
  fields:
    - no label: userAge
      datatype: integer
  ---
  mandatory: True 
  code: |
    if userAge > 22:
      jobSeeker
    elif userAge > 25
      ausStudy
    else:
      contactUs
  ---
  ```

  Why won't our application execute in Docassemble?
  <Answer>
  The test we are using to assess `userAge` is incorrect.
  </Answer>
  <Answer isCorrect>
  We are missing a `:` at the end of our `elif` statement clause.
  </Answer>
  <Answer>
  There is no space between `elif` and `userAge`.
  </Answer>
  <Explanation correctAnswer>
  That's right. Our `elif` statement is testing whether the user's age is greater than 25. We need to put a space between the `elif` and the condition (that is, the variable `userAge` we are assessing). We need to then termiante this with a `:`.
  </Explanation>
  <Explanation>
  That's not right. Remember:
  * We want to assess whether the user is greater than 25 (if they are not greater than 22);
  * We need to put a space between this test and the `elif`; and,
  * We need to terminate this `elif` clause with a `:`.
  </Explanation>
</Quizlet>

## Improving our application
You might have noticed that there is a bit of repetition in ```Ch4_Magistrates_Court_Tool.yml```. For example, we make multiple calls to ```courtEndscreen``` on Lines 20, 24, 28, 32 and 36. It would be easier if we just had one call to ```courtEndscreen``` if the user did not set ```userLocation``` to None of the above. To do this, we would need to use nested if statements, which we will cover in the next section.
