Let's log in to Docassemble again.  Go to the <DisplayConstants data='dahref' />.  You should end up at this screen.

Let's discuss this screen:
1. The black bar across the top is called the **Navbar**.
It exists at the top of every screen and contains menu bars and other information.
1. This is the **Interview Title** or **App Title**.
When you write your app you'll put its name, and maybe your client's logo in this space.
1. In this book we'll be calling this the **Drop-down menu** or the **menu bar** or just the **menu**.
We use this menu to navigate around Docassemble.
We've [already used this once](./00-20#set-up-github-integration) and we'll be using it a lot more!
1. Without wishing to state the obvious, this is the main body of the app.
When you're writing this area will display the [Playground](#the-playground), which we will now discuss.

:::tip TODO
The terms we've just defined here should probably be put into some kind of
data structure and/or component so they can be extracted into index entries
