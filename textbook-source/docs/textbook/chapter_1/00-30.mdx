## What is Docassemble?
:::tip TODO
Need to build this out.  Give an introduction to:

* That DA allows us to write web apps
* It's open source, so we dont' need to pay licensing fees and, more importantly, our clients don't need to
pay licensing fees to use our apps
* The web apps we write are 'resonsive'.  That is, they will run just as well on a mobile phone 
or a table as on a desktop computer
* DA allows us to create document templates easily using Word documents and Jinja code.
* Despite any hesitations you might have, DA is not that difficult to learn or, more importantly, it allows
you to write useful apps after learning a few basic conccepts.
* Docassemble generates some reasonably good looking apps.  Insert examples- iRefer, Hutt Street Centre. 
Also include clerq and Mass Access apps.

## The Main Screen
Let's log in to Docassemble again.  Go to the <Components.DisplayConstants data={dahref} />.  You should end up at this screen.

<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_1/docassemble_after_signin_screen_annotated.png' />

Let's discuss this screen:

1. The black bar across the top is called the **Navbar**.
It exists at the top of every screen and contains menu bars and other information.
1. This is the **Interview Title** or **App Title**.
When you write your app you'll put its name, and maybe your client's logo in this space.
1. In this book we'll be calling this the **Drop-down menu**, or just the **menu**.
We use this menu to navigate around Docassemble.
We've [already used this once](./00-20#set-up-github-integration) and we'll be using it a lot more!
1. Without wishing to state the obvious, this is the main body of the app.
When you're writing this area will display the [Playground](#the-playground), which we will now discuss.

:::tip TODO
The terms we've just defined here should probably be put into some kind of
data structure and/or component so they can be extracted into index entries
:::

## The Playground
Docassemble's 'Playground' is where we'll spend most of this topic.  The Playground is where you will edit,
test, debug and run your code.  Let's explore it.

Select *Playground* from the down menu.  You'll be taken to a screen that looks like this:

<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_1/docassemble_main_screen1.png' />

Let's break this screen into its parts:

1. This is the **Navbar**.  Its claim to fame is the *Playground* menu in the top left
which we can use to create 'Projects'.
2. This is where you manage your files and folders and where you can search for text in a file.
We won't be using the *Wizard* or *Upload* buttons in this topic.
3. This is the text editor. It's where you'll be writing your code.
4. These buttons allow you save and run your code.
5. This panel contains the variable you use in your code.  We will discuss variables
in detail later in this book.
6. The lower part of the Playground contains a Docassemble quick reference.

Let's work through these in a bit more detail.

### 1. Navbar and *Playground* Menu
The Playground is where we will develop our apps.  Everything we need for our app, such as
code files, Word templates, images and so-on are kept in our Playground.  In short, an
app consists of many different files.

As you work on more and more projects you'll find that the Plaground can become quite cluttered
and looking for files becomes difficult.  Thankfully, Docassemble allows us to create different
'Projects' in our Playground to help keep us organised.  This is done through the *Playground*
menu on the top-left.  Click on that menu to create multiple projects.

:::tip
Check out [Switching Projects](https://docassemble.org/docs/playground.html#projects) in the 
Docassemble manual for more information on creating projects in the Playground
:::

### 2. Manging Files and folders
This area allows us to create, manage and organise our files.  The Search bar allows us to search for text
in the current file.

#### Adding a file
1. Click on *Add*
2. Enter the name of your file.
:::note
Your file name should not contain any spaces and it should always end with a `.yml`.
(eg: use `Assessment_C4.yml` instead of `Assessment C4.yml` or `Assessment C4`)
:::
3. Enter something in the main text window
4. Press <Components.DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_save_prop} />

#### Folders
We only have five folders.  We cannot, and do not need to, create any more.

<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_1/docassemble_main_screen2.png' />

Each folder serves a special purpose:
* **Packages** - contains information about the software you create.  It allows you to bundle
all the different files that make up your app into a single package for distribution.
* **Templates** - is where we will store Word files that we can use to generate forms and
document templates.
* **Static files** - is where we will store images, like company logos, that we want to make 
a part of our app.
* **Sources** - is where we can store other files relevant to our app.  We won't be using this
folder in this textbook.
* **Modules** - is where we can store custom Python programs, or 'modules' to use in our app.
We won't be using this folder in this textbook.

:::tip
The Docassemble manual has more detailed explanations about the [Packages](https://docassemble.org/docs/playground.html#packages),
[Templates](https://docassemble.org/docs/playground.html#templates) and the
[Static files](https://docassemble.org/docs/playground.html#static) folders.

### 3. Text Editor
The text editor is where you will write your code.  The numbers down the side are line numbers.  Line numbers
are very useful when trying to pinpoint code that isn't working properly.

You can see that the code you write changes colour as you write it.  This is called *syntax highlighting*. 
Syntax highlighting is useful because it visually distinguishes different parts of code by applying colors
to different elements of your code. This helps coders to quickly identify errors,
and understand the structure of their code, leading to faster and more accurate coding.

### 4. Buttons
The <Components.DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_save_prop} />
and <Components.DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_save_and_run_prop} /> buttons
do what you would expect, as do
the <Components.DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_download_prop} />
 and <Components.DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_delete_prop} /> buttons.

The *Share* button will give you a link to a running version of the current file in the Playground.  This is 
a useful way to share an application you're working on with a client or your team.

### 5. Variables
Variables are a way of storing data in your program.  We will discuss this later in the textbook.
:::tip TODO
Insert link to wherever we will discuss variables
:::

This panel contains a list of the variables used in your program.  It is a useful debugging tool because:

* variables properly defined appear in <Components.Highlight color={Constants.da_declared_variable}>blue</Components.Highlight>
* variables that are not used appear in <Components.Highlight color={Constants.da_unused_variable}>orange</Components.Highlight>;
* variables that Docassemble expects to find but can't (ie: 'undefined variables') appear in <Components.Highlight color={Constants.da_undeclared_variable}>dark red</Components.Highlight>.

If you see a sea of blue in this panel it's a good sign that your program will run.

### 6. Quick Reference
The bottom half of the screen contains a quick reference to Docassemble.  The reference is quite extensive
and, usefully, contains example code and a preview of what the code looks like when run.  The screen below
shows the different way to use Markdown to format text and images in your code.
