## What is GitHub?
<Components.DisplayConstants data='github' /> is a tool used by coders to work together on code.  The good news about GitHub is that it's an industry standard and it integrates with Docassemble.
The bad news about GitHub is that it can be a bit fiddly to use.  It's designed with coders in mind (obviously!) and it scales up to manage very
large projects.  We'll only be using a subset of GitHub's features and <Components.DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_6' /> will take you through how to use GitHub in detail.  For now, we just need to sign up and connect GitHub and Docassemble together.

Let's get started

## Get a GitHub account
You do this in the usual way.  

1. Go to <Components.DisplayConstants data='github' />, click on the *Sign up* button
  <Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_1/github_signup1.png' />
1. Enter your Flinders email address, a password and press *Continue*
  <Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_1/github_signup2.png' />

  :::note

  You must sign up with your Flinders email ie: ***your_fan*@flinders.edu.au** and you must use your FAN as your GitHub username. 

  You should sign up with your Flinders email even if you already have a FAN.
  This makes it easier for teaching staff to establish your identity on GitHub.

  :::

1. You will then be asked for a username.  Enter your FAN.  Press *Continue* again.
  <Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_1/github_signup3.png' />
1. Type in 'n' for product updates and press *Continue* again.
  <Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_1/github_signup4.png' />
1. Work through the CAPTCHA puzzle and then press *Create Account*
1. You'll be asked to enter a code that has been emailed to your Flinders email.  Enter that code.
1. You're then taken to a Welcome screen.  Identify yourself as a student and that you'll be working with a group of 2 - 5 others.
  <Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_1/github_signup5.png' />
1. Scroll to the bottom of the next screen and press *Continue*
  <Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_1/github_signup6.png' />
1. At the next screen you have the option to sign up for Student benefits.  You may if you're interested but we won't need these.  Signing up for a free account is fine.
  <Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_1/github_signup7.png' />
1. You'll then be taken to your GitHub landing page.
  <Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_1/github_signup8.png' />

That's all we need for now.  You're signed up to GitHub.  Now we need to connect GitHub and Docassemble together.

## Set up GitHub integration
Now that you have a GitHub account we need to let Docassemble know.
1. Log in to Docassemble.  You should end up at the *Resume Interview* page
  <Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_1/docassemble_after_signin_screen.png' />
1. Select *Profile* from the right-hand menu
  <Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_1/github_integration1.png' />
1. Click on *Other Settings* and then *GitHub integration*
  <Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_1/github_integration2.png' />
1. Click on *Configure*
  <Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_1/github_integration3.png' />
1. If you signed out of GitHub you may be asked to sign in again.
  <Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_1/github_integration4.png' />
1. Otherwise, you'll be presented with this authorisation screen.
  <Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_1/github_integration5.png' />
1. Click on *Authorize LLAW3301*.  After some time you'll be taken back to Docassemble and you'll see a message stating that the integration was configured.
  <Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_1/github_integration6.png' />

That's it! You now have Docassemble and GitHub connected to each other.
