## Accessing Docassemble
We use <DisplayConstants data='daorghref' /> as our teaching platform. To work
through this textbook you will need access to the Flinders University <DisplayConstants data='dahref' />.
Let's work through getting access.

1. Your account has been created for you already.  The account login is your Flinders email ie: *your_FAN*@flinders.edu.au (**not** *firstname.lastname*@flinders.edu.au).
1. Go to the <DisplayConstants data='dahref' text='Flinders University Docassemble Server' /> and you'll be presented with a login page that looks like this:
  > ![image](/img/textbook/chapter_1/docassemble_home_page.png)
