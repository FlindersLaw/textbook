title: Vital Statistics - A More Sophisticated Example
---
import * as Constants from '@site/src/constants'
import * as Components from '@site/src/components'
import {DisplayGlossaryItem} from '@site/src/components';
import {DisplayChapter} from '@site/src/components';

We've learnt lots of things over this chapter.  We can write code!  We can also:
*  ask questions;
* use <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='markdown' upper /> to format and 
display text;
* we know the difference between <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='mandatoryblock' plural />
and regular <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='questionblock' plural />;
* We can use tables to set out our final screens;
* We can present choices in a drop-down; and
* We can create custom word and PDF documents based on the answers we receive.

The code below is for an app called 'Vital Statistics'.  It presents some important
information about the user and in the process makes more use of what we have
learnt so far.  The code uses a lot of what we have learnt over the course of
this chapter and also introduces a few new concepts.  Let's work through it.

```

### Lines 30 to 33
We're starting at line 30 because this is where some of the new concepts are.
If you read through lines 1 to 29 you'll see a mandatory question block that
looks very similar to our [Hello World 5](./00-50) example.  The table has
different information (and we'll come back to that) but otherwise this code
is very similar to `hello_world5.yml`.

Let's look at lines 30 to 33
```yaml
question: How old are you?
fields:
  - no label: MJFage
    datatype: integer
```
First, we have [seen `no label` before](./00-30#the-second-question-block).
What we haven't seen however is line 30:
```yaml
    dataype: integer
```
Firstly, we can see that the word `datatype` is aligned with `no label`.  You'll
recall that line 29 has the dash-label-variable format that we have seen 
[before](./00-42#presenting-choices-in-a-question) and which 'declares' a
variable.  That is, line 29 is telling Docassemble how to ask a question so
we can get a value for a variable, `MJFage` in this case.

Line 30, because of the alignment and the lack of a dash, is tied to line 29.
Line 30 is giving us more information about variable declared at line 29.
We say that line 30 *describes*, or *modifies*,
the variable declaration at line 29.

Line 30 is sets the 'data type' of the variable `MJFage` to be an integer.

:::info What is a Data Type?
As we said [early on](./00-20#variables), `MJFage` is a variable and we 
can 'put stuff in' a variable.  By stuff we mean data.  **We store data
in a variable**.

We can have different types of data.  Up until now we have been storing text,
or <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='string' plural /> in our variables.
Strings are the default data type.  There are also other data types, as we'll
see as we work our way through this textbook.

Line 30 sets the data type to be an **integer**.
An [**integer** data type](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#numbers)
allows us to store whole numbers only (ie: 1, 2,
3, 4 etc).  We can't store a string in an integer data type.  If we do we'll
get an error:
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/vitalstatistics-1.png' />

Using a data type can be useful to control, or *validate* the input a user
enters.  In our case, we are forcing the user to enter a number and not words
into this text box.  This could come in handy later if we, say, wanted to 
check the number was bigger or smaller than another number.  For example, we
might want to check the age to make sure a user is over 18 years old and
therefore an adult.
:::

### Lines 37 to 41
```yaml
  - Are you employed?: MJFisemployed
    datatype: radio
    choices:
      - Yes
      - No
```
Here we again see a variable declaration at line 37, with a `datatype` modifier
at line 38.  This time, the data type is `radio`.
A [radio data type](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#radio) presents
a list of choices to the user and requires them to select only one choice.
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/vitalstatistics-2.png' />

This means only the values `Yes` or `No` can be placed into `MJFisemployed`.

:::note
`Yes` and `No` are <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='string' /> values.
As we'll see further in this text book, when we want to ask a 'yes or no' 
question, a better way to do so is to use a <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='boolean' />
data type.
:::

### Lines 42 to 46
```yaml
  - What is your {income}?: MJFannualincome
    datatype: currency
    show if: 
      variable: MJFisemployed
      is: 'Yes'
```
We will discuss the braces (`{}`) in line 42 in the next section.

#### Line 43
We've seen two different `datatype`s so far and line 43 introduces a third: 
`currency`.  The [currency](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#currency)
data type is used, unsurprisingly, to display money amounts.  It forces the
user to enter a number with two or more digits after the decimal point.  If
more than two digits are entered, they are rounded up to two digits, so that
this:
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/vitalstatistics-4.png' />
Is rounded to this:
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/vitalstatistics-5.png' />

Just like the `integer` data type, it is not possible to enter non-integer 
values, such as characters:
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/vitalstatistics-6.png' />
or even the dollar sign!
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/vitalstatistics-7.png' />

#### Line 44
Line 44, like line 43 above it, are aligned with the label on line 42.  As 
[already discussed](./00-60#lines-30-to-33), this means that line 44 modifies
line 42.  In this case, the [`show if` statement](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#show%20if)
tells Docassemble only to 
display Line 42 if the criteria set out on lines 45 and 46 are met.

#### Line 45
This is the first part of the criterion.  The `variable:` tag tells Docassemble
that it must check the value of the variable (in this case `MJFisemployed`).

#### Line 46
This tells Docassemble what the value of the variable specified in line 45 should
contain.  Line 46 is saying that value should be `Yes`.

Therefore, lines 44, 45 and 46 together tell Docassemble that the variable set
out on line 42 should only be displayed if the value of `MJFisemployed` is set
to `Yes`.  If we select the `Yes` radio button, we can see that the question
is automatically displayed:
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/vitalstatistics-8.png' />
and if we select `No` for `MJFisemployed` then the question is hidden:
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/vitalstatistics-9.png' />

This is a good way of displaying to a user only the relevant questions in an
application.

:::caution
Using `show if` is a great way to control what information is displayed to 
a user.  In this app if the user is not employed and so there is no point asking
them for their income. Using `show if` is an effective way of hiding the income
question in a context where it would be redundant.

**However**, what happens if, in your final screen, you decide to display a
value for `MJFannualincome` if a user says they are not employed?

Copy the code into your playground, run it and see what happens.  We'll cover
this issue further down this page.
:::

### Lines 42 and 47 to 49
```yaml
  - What is your {income}?: MJFannualincome
...
terms:
  income: |
    Your income should be your gross (ie: before tax) income
```
The braces (`{}`) surrounding the word `income` tell Docassemble to look for 
a [term](https://docassemble.org/docs/modifiers.html#terms).  Terms are used
to display pop-up text when the word is clicked on:
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/vitalstatistics-3.png' />

Terms are a great way to display pop-up help text.

### Lines 55 to 63
```yaml
  - no label: MJFhobbies
    datatype: checkboxes
    choices:
      - Flying
      - Running
      - Playing music
      - Writing code
      - Studying (Yes, really!)
      - Socialising
```
Line 55 is yet another variable declaration.  It's followed by a `datatype` 
modifier in line **56**.  This time, the data type is `checkboxes`.  The 
[`checkboxes` datatype](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#fields%20checkboxes)
displays a list wich checkboxes.  A user can tick multiple boxes and which values
have been ticked (and not ticked) are stored in `MJFhobbies` (in this case).

We have seen the `choices` line that is line **57** a few times before, for 
displaying a [drop-down menu](./00-42#lines-35-to-38) and also for the
[radio buttons](./00-60#lines-37-to-41) we discussed above.  As our data type
is `checkboxes`, the `choices` to be displayed will be the items that make up
the checkbox list.  

And, finally, we can see these items in lines **58 to 63**.

:::note
We're getting a little ahead of ourselves here.  You'll notice that this is
the first time you'll have come across a variable (`MJFhobbies`) that will
have stored in it *multiple* data. In this case we are storing a
the list of choices along 
with information about whether they have been selected or not.  

It *is* possible to store more than one thing in a variable. We will cover 
how and why we do this in <Components.DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_05' />
:::

### Line 13
Yes, we're skipping back up to the top of our code.
```yaml
  Your annual income    | ${ currency(MJFannualincome) }
```
This line displays a row of data in the [table](./00-42#displaying-output-in-a-table)
which starts in line 8.  The first column has text (`Your annual income`) and the
second column contains some Mako (`${ ... }`).  The interesting part of line 
13 is this `currency` and parentheses that surround our `MJFannualincome`
variable.  This is a <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='function' />.
It's called, unsurprisingly, the 'currency function', or the
'currency() function'. The currency function takes a number (ie: an 
`integer` datatype or a `currency` datatype) and displays that number as
a currency, ie: with a `$` sign and the number printed to two decimal places.

:::tip
Try removing the `currency(` and the `)` that surround `MJFannualincome`
in line 13 and run the code.  See what happens.
:::

:::info
By placing parentheses (`()`) after the word 
'currency' we're differentiating the function from the regular word but 
also from the datatype.  It is very common practice in IT to append function
names with `()`.
:::

:::info What's a Function?
For the purpose of this textbook we will consider functions to be bits of
code that we can use to manipulate our variables.  For example, we can use
functions to [display a number as a currency](https://docassemble.org/docs/functions.html#currency),
to [format dates](https://docassemble.org/docs/functions.html#format_date) and
many other things.  Docassemble has an
[extensive library](https://docassemble.org/docs/functions.html) of functions
that we can use to manipluate our data.
:::

### Line 14
```yaml
  Your favourite hobbies| ${ MJFhobbies.true_values() }
```
Again, we have something we haven't seen before in our Mako.  In this case
we have `.true_values()` appended to `MJFhobbies`.  
This is called a <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='method' />.  It's a bit
like a functionn, in that it helps us manipulate variable, but a method is
attached to a variable.  In this case, the `true_values()` method will display
the values in our checkbox list that have been selected as a nice
comma-separated list.
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/vitalstatistics-10.png' />

:::info
The difference between functions and methods and their syntax is something
that is beyond the scope of this textbook.  All you need to know is that 
functions look like this:
```
function(variable)
```
and methods look like this:
```
variable.method()
```
:::

## A Note About The Question Blocks
:::note
Up to now we have looked at code examples with only one or two question
blocks in them.  Our example above has five question blocks.  The first
is a mandatory block and the other four are regular question blocks.

Have a look through our [previous discussion](./00-20#execution-order) about
the order in which Docassemble executes code and try to apply that logic to
this Vital Statistics code.
:::

## Fixing the Bug
As alluded to [earlier](./00-60#line-13) there's a bug in this code.

The code runs fine (I hope you've tried it!) but if you select 'No' to
the 'Are you employed' question and
press <Components.DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_save_prop} button_text='Continue' />
nothing happens.  Why is this?

Let's go back to the code and look at the mandatory block.
```yml showLineNumbers
---
mandatory: True
question: Vital Statistics
subquestion: |
  Thanks for completing the Vital Statistics Survey.
  We have collected this data from you
  
  Information|Your Input
  -----------|----------
  Your name             | ${ MJFsalutation } ${ MJFfirstname } ${ MJFlastname }
  Your age              | ${ MJFage }
  Are you employed?     | ${ MJFisemployed }
  Your annual income    | ${ currency(MJFannualincome) }
  Your favourite hobbies| ${ MJFhobbies.true_values() }
buttons:
  - I'm done: exit
  - Do it again!: restart
---
```
As we know, Docassemble works its way through the mandatory block line by line, top to bottom.
As it sees <DisplayGlossaryItem item='mako' upper /> blocks it processes the necessary
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='questionblock' plural /> to get the values it needs to display the
output.

In our example, Docassemble will come across `MJFsalutation` first.  It needs a value for that
variable, so it finds and processes the question block at line 19.  In the process it also
collects answers to `MJFfirstname` and `MJFlastname` as both of these are in the same question
block.

The next Mako blocks contain `MJFfirstname` and `MJFlastname`.  Docassemble already has these
(as per above!) and doesn't ask the question block on line 19 again.

Now we go to the next line.  Docassemble sees a Mako for `MJFage`.  It then finds and processes
the question block on line 30 to get the user's age.  Next line it sees `MJFisemployed`, so it
processes the question block on line 35.  Now our problems start.

If we answer `Yes` to the employment question the program runs fine.  If we answer `No` then 
the program stops here.  Why?  Well, it's because the *next* line in the mandatory block contains
Mako requring a value for `MJFannualincome`.  But, if we say we're not employed the question for
`MJFannualincome` (on lines 42 to 46) is never asked.  This is because the `show if` only displays
this question if `MJFisemployed` is set to `Yes`.  Here's our problem.  We can never move past
this point when we're not employed.

When we use `show if` and other conditional displays we need to make sure we account for the
case where the variable is never populated.  There are a number of ways to do this but for now
what we'll do is hide line 13 if we're not employed.

We hide line 13 by wrapping it in an <DisplayGlossaryItem item='ifstatement' />.  That is,
we'll tell Docassemble that *if* we are employed *then* display line 13, and by implication
if we're not employed then line 13 will be skipped.  Our new code will look something like
this:
```yml showLineNumbers
---
mandatory: True
question: Vital Statistics
subquestion: |
  Thanks for completing the Vital Statistics Survey.
  We have collected this data from you
  
  Information|Your Input
  -----------|----------
  Your name             | ${ MJFsalutation } ${ MJFfirstname } ${ MJFlastname }
  Your age              | ${ MJFage }
  Are you employed?     | ${ MJFisemployed }
  // highlight-next-line
  %if MJFisemployed == 'Yes': 
  Your annual income    | ${ currency(MJFannualincome) }
  // highlight-next-line
  %endif
  Your favourite hobbies| ${ MJFhobbies.true_values() }
buttons:
  - I'm done: exit
  - Do it again!: restart
---
```
Our line 13 is now line 14.  It is wrapped with a `%if` statement.  That statements says
that if the value of `MJFisemployed` is equal to `Yes` then carry out the instructions between
the `%if` and `%endif` lines.  In this case, the instructions are to display the
`MJFannualincome` line.

Try updating your code and insert the `%if`/`%endif` statements as per above.  Run your application
and this time say that you are not employed.  The application should now run to completion.

:::note
We cover `%if` statements in more detail in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_04' />.  If you're
confused as to why we use `==` instead of `=` to check if `MJFisemployed` is equal to `Yes` then
check out [Testing Variables](/docs/textbook/chapter_03/00-30).
