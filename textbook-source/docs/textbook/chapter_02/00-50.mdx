title: Hello World 5 - Introducing Jinja

So far, we've seen how Docassemble can take input from a user, by way of 
question blocks, and display output on the screen, using mandatory question
blocks and Markdown.  Docassemble can also prepare Word documents and PDF 
documents.  Let's explore this.

Up to now we have constructed an output screen using Markdown in a mandatory
question block.  When we want to input the value of a variable we 
insert <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='mako' upper /> into our Markdown.
With word documents we can do something similar.  We can prepare a template
Word document with the text and styling and images that we want.  When we
want to insert the value of a variable we
use <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='jinja' upper /> instead of Mako. 
That's very useful for us as we can prepare printable high-quality documents
with corporate logos and styles that contain information from our app.

Jinja works in a similar way to Mako but the syntax is a little different. 
Where Mako looks like this:  
```
${ variable_name }
```
Jinja looks like this:  
```
{{ variable_name }}
```
Just like Mako, what's inside Jinja double-braces is evaluated as
a <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='python' upper /> expression.  So,
if we look at the Mako from [Hello World 4](./00-42#line-8),
```
${ MJFsalutation + ' ' + MJFlastname }
```
that line could be represented as follows as Jinja in a Word document.
```
{{ MJFsalutation + ' ' + MJFlastname }}
```

## A Simple Example
Download and open this [Word document](/templates/First_Docassemble_Template.docx).
Let's take a look at it.

<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/hello_world5-1.png' />

Note how the first two Jinja variables are in bold.  We've done this by 
simply bolding the text in Word, as we would any other text.  We control 
text formatting using Word's usual formatting.

We can, for example, change the colour of the Jina on the third line to red
by using Word's usual formatting. No Markdown required!

<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/hello_world5-2.png' />

Make change the colour of the third line to red and save the word document.  
Then, let's upload it to Docassemble.

## Adding a Word Document to Your Docassemble App
There are two parts to adding a Word document to a Docassemble app:
1. upload the document into the Playground; and
1. point your app to the document.

### Upload the Document to the Playground
:::caution
Before we upload, it is very important to be aware that Docassemble **does not**
like spaces in document file names.  If you downloaded the Word document as
[instructed above](#a-simple-example) you probably saved it as
`First Docassemble Template.docx`.  We need to get rid of the spaces in 
the document name before we upload it.

Best practice is to change spaces to underscores (`_`).  So, rename
`First Docassemble Template.docx` to `First_Docassemble_Template.docx`.

Now we're ready to upload
:::

Word documents must be stored in the **Templates** folder of your app.
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/hello_world5-3.png' />

#### To upload your document:
1. go to the Templates folder;
1. click on Browse and select your Word document; and
1. click on <Components.DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_save_prop} button_text='Upload' />.
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/hello_world5-4.png' />


The document will be uploaded and appear in your 'Existing template files' list.
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/hello_world5-5.png' />

:::note
It's not clear from the screenshot but the file has actually been uploaded
as `First_Docassemble_Template.docx` and not `First Docassemble Template.docx`.
The hyperlink obscures the underscores but they are there.
:::

Your Word file is uploaded. Click `<Back` to go to your Playground.

:::info
You cannot edit a Word file that has been uploaded into the Templates folder.
If you click on the file in the 'Existng template files' list Docassemble will
allow you to download a copy of the file.

If you want to make changes to your template file you need to go through a cycle
of:
1. download the file from the 'Existing template files' list;
1. save the word document to your computer;
1. edit the file and save your changes; and
1. upload the saved file back into the Templates folder.

When you upload your new file Docassemble will overwrite your existing uploaded
file (provided the files have the same name of course!).
:::

### Point Your App to the Uploaded Document
Docassemble uses an [`attachment`](https://docassemble.org/docs/documents.html#attachment) key to 
connect an app to a Word document.

We have an example of this below.  This example is essentially the code
in [Hello World 4](./00-42#our-code) but with the `attachment:` specifier added.
A copy of this code is also available in `C1_05_hello_world.yml` in the 
teaching code repository.  Look at lines 26 and 27 of the code.

```yaml
---
# My first Docassemble program
mandatory: True
question: Hello World!
subquestion: |
  ### Welcome to Docassemble!

  Dear ${ MJFsalutation + ' ' + MJFlastname },

  This is a quick introduction to Markdown.

  Two lines for a line break
  because a single line doesn't break at all.

  - Here's a list
  - with some items
  - in it

  **Here's some bold text** and *text in italics*.

  Column1|Column2
  -------|-------
  Salutation|${ MJFsalutation }
  First Name|${ MJFfirstname }
  Last Name|${ MJFlastname }
attachment:
  docx template file: First_Docassemble_Template.docx
buttons:
  - I'm done: exit
    url: https://flinders.edu.au
  - Do it again: restart
---
question: Name
fields:
  - Salutation: MJFsalutation
    choices:
      - Dr
      - Mr
      - Mrs
      - Ms
  - First Name: MJFfirstname
  - Last Name: MJFlastname
---
```
This is enough to link our document to our app.

## Running an App with an attachment
When an attachment is added to a Docassemble app Docassemble will display 
that attachment as part of the question block in which the attachment is
declared.

You will see from our code that our question block starts at line 2 (next
line below the `---`) and finishes at line 32 (line before `---`).  That
question block contains our `attachment` on lines 26 and 27.  So, Docassemble
will display our file when it displays this question block.

If you run the app you will see a final screen that looks something like this.
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/hello_world5-6.png' />

Additional content has been added below our exit and restart buttons.  This
content allows a user to download the Word document, or the Word document as 
a PDF.  It also allows the user to email the document to themselves.

If we open the Word document we will see that our Jinja has been replaced with
the variables from our app.  Note also that our formatting (including the
red text!) has been preserved.
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/hello_world5-7.png' />

:::note
You may not want your app users to download a Word *and* a PDF document.  
Usually, you want users only to download a PDF or a Word version.

The `attachment` specifier allows you to do this.  In fact, there's quite a 
lot you can do with `attachment`s.  Get familiar with its capabilities
in the [Docassemble manual](https://docassemble.org/docs/documents.html#attachment).
