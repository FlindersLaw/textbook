title: Chapter 2. An Introduction to Coding with Docassemble
---
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {DisplayChapter} from '@site/src/components';

In this chapter we start teaching you how to code in Docassemble.  You are
welcome to read this chapter from beginning to end. However we recommend that
you do so while at the same time working through the
[**Chapter 2 Coding Exercises**](/docs/coding_exercises/ch2_exercises)

Our experience has been that students that read through this chapter without practising
as they go face more difficulties understanding the material than students who attempt
the coding exercises as they read through this chapter.

:::caution
You must have completed the setup activites in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_01' />
before starting on this chapter.
