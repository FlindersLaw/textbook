title: Hello World 2 - Introducing Markdown and Mako
---
import * as Constants from '@site/src/constants'
import * as Components from '@site/src/components'

Our existing [Hello World](./00-10) program, while truly a software engineering masterpiece,
is somewhat impersonal.  What we *really* want it to do is to display the user's name and,
for good measure, display their **name in bold**.

Let's get to making that happen.

## Create a new file
First thing is to create a new file and copy the code over.

1. Before you create the new file, copy the existing code in the text editor.
We'll paste it into the new file shortly.
1. Click on the <Components.DisplayImage altText='Add' imageURL='/img/textbook/add_button.png' inline />
button and create a new file called `hello_world2.yml`.
:::tip
Refer to how we did this [previously](./00-10/#your-first-program).
:::
1. Paste the code you copied from `hello_world.yml` into this new file and 
press <Components.DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_save_prop} />.
1. Then press <Components.DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_save_and_run_prop} />
to make sure the program still runs OK.

## Make some changes
Edit the file in your playground and make it look like this.
Remember to pay particular
attention to [indents, spacing and dashes](./00-10/#indents-spacing-and-dashes-oh-my) and your braces and brackes (more on this [below](./00-20/#mako))

```yaml title="hello_world2.yml" showLineNumbers

# Our second program!  Now with personality!
mandatory: True
question: Hello World!
subquestion: |
  Hello **${ MJFname }**

  Welcome to Docassemble!
---
question: Name
fields:
    - What is your name?: MJFname
---
```
Let's work through this new code.

### Line 6
Our boring old `Hello,` looks a bit more complex.  We've actuall introduced 
three new concepts here:
1. A <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='variable' />
1. <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='mako' upper />
1. <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='markdown' upper />

Let's work through each of these.

#### Variables
The text `MJFname` is a <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='variable' />. We're going to use it store the user's name.

A variable is kind of like a bucket.  You can put stuff in a bucket and you can put stuff in a variable.

Variable|Bucket
---|---
Used to store stuff|Used to store stuff
Must have a name|Doesn't usually have a name
Can (usually) only store one thing|Can store lots of stuff

:::tip TODO

A variable is useful because we can change what we put in it each time we run the program.

In our code, our variable is called `MJFname`.  We want to store a name in 
our variable `MJFname`.

The variable's name is broken into two parts.  The `name` part should be pretty clear.  It describes what we're going to store in this variable
(ie: someone's name).  The `MJF` part is the initials of the author of the code
(Mark Ferraretto).  Adding initials to a variable is optional.  We don't *need* to add `MJF` to the beginning of this
variable's name, but if we do we get two benefits:
1. When we do a search through the code it's easy to identify where the variables are; and
1. Our variables will never be named after a <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='reservedword' />.  Docassemble attaches special meaning to certain
words, like `if`, `and`, `for` and a number of others. By putting `MJF` in front of the variable's name we'll ensure that we'll never accidentally use
a reserved word as a variable.

:::info
The prefix to the variable's name doesn't necessarily need to be `MJF`.  It 
could be your own initials, or something that represents the program - we 
could have used `HWname` (for Hello World) instead of `MJFname`.  
:::

#### Mako
At line 6 our variable `MJFname` is enclosed by a pair of braces (`{}`) and a 
dollar sign (`$`).  This is called <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='mako' upper />.  

We use Mako to tell Docassemble to display what we have stored in a variable, 
or to display the **value** of a variable.  We will usually find Mako in a `subquestion:` as we use `subquestion`s to display our detailed output in 
Docassemble.

:::note
Mako is used to display the value stored in a variable.  But how do we store
something in a variable?  We do that using <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='field' plural />, which we discuss below
:::

:::tip TODO

:::

:::info
You can also use Mako in <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='fieldlabel' plural />.
We'll get to that later in this book.
:::

:::caution
Just like the [indents, spacing and dashes](./00-10/#indents-spacing-and-dashes-oh-my), Docassemble is also very fussy about 
brackets.  
There's few different kinds that you should remember:
* `{ }` are <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='brace' plural /> or <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='curlybrace' plural />
* `[ ]` are <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='bracket' plural /> or <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='squarebracket' plural />
* `( )` are <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='parentheses' />

Make sure you remember these terms as we will use them extensively in this book.
:::

#### Markdown
Finally, let's get to these asterisks (`*`).

:::info
In nerdy-nerdy coding land we call asterisks (ie: `*`) 'stars'.  We'll be referring to
`*` as 'stars' throughout this book.
:::

If we place two stars around some text (eg `**some text**`) Docassemble will
format that text as **bold** (ie: **some text**).  This double-star syntax is 
part of a formatting language called <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='markdown' upper />.  Markdown is very useful for doing simple text
formatting.  In fact, this textbook is written using Markdown.  Markdown allows you to display text in **bold** and *italics*.  It can create headings
and subheadings (as we use in this book).  It can be used to display images
and links to webpages.

There are two great Markdown references.  The first is the [Quick Reference](../chapter_01/00-30#6-quick-reference) in your Playground.  There is also an
official [Markdown manual](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github) which contains a more comprehensive explanation of 
Markdown.

#### Putting Line 6 Together
Now that we know all about variables, Mako and Markdown we can see that line 6
does the following:
1. It displays the word 'Hello'
1. It uses Mako to display the value in `MJFname`, and
1. It formats that value in bold using Markdown.

Next step then is to get the value of the variable.  We now know how to display
what's in there, but how do we put a value into `MJFname`? Read on!

### Lines 10 to 12
Lines 10 to 12 are another <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='questionblock' />.  Line 10 will display the text 'Name' as the title of
this question block.  Line 11 and 12 are what we use to collect and store data
into a variable - `MJFname` in this case.

Line 11 is a `fields:` tag.  This tells Docassemble that this question block 
will be used to collect data and store them in variables.  Line 12 is a <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='field' /> line.  A `fields:` tag can be
followed by many fields.  We only need one for now though.

The field line in line 12 tells Docassemble to display a friendly <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='fieldlabel' /> ('What is your name?') and a text field to 
collect the value for the variable `MJFname` from the user.

## Execution Order
Our code now has two question blocks, one at lines lines 3 to 8, and the second at lines 10 to 12.  Only the first block is a <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='mandatoryquestionblock' /> though.  How does 
Docassemble know to execute the second block?

Let's work through the execution step using this diagram.

<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/execution_order1.png' />

1. Docassemble scans the program code from the top of the file...
2. ...until it finds a mandatory block.  It then executes the mandatory
block line by line.
3. When it enounters this Mako, Docassemble tries to substitute the value of
`MJFname` into this line.
> * Only problem is that `MJFname` doesn't have a value yet.
> * So, Docassemble stops processing the Mandatory block and starts looking
  for a block that sets a value for `MJFname`.
4. Docassemble scans our code file again, now looking for a block that sets
a value for `MJFname`.  It finds our question block at line 10 and processes
that block.  That causes this question to be asked:
  <Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/execution_order2.png' />
5. Now that it has the value of `MJFname`, Docassemble starts processing the
mandatory question block again.
6. Docassemble comes to this Mako again.  Now it *does* have a value for
`MJFname`, so it can display it.
 Docassemble scans the rest of the question block.  Because there's no other
Mako to process, Docassemble is ready to display this question block, which it does.
  <Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/execution_order3.png' />
7. The execution stops now.

:::note
The reason execution stops at step 7 is because we haven't placed anything on the 
screen, like a <Components.DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_save_prop} button_text='Continue' /> 
button, that allows the user to continue to run the application.  If we did have a <Components.DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_save_prop} button_text='Continue' /> button
Docassemble would have continued scanning the rest of our file looking for
another mandatory block to execute.  We don't have any other mandatory
blocks.  Docassemble therefore would have scanned our code, not found any
additional mandatory blocks and would then have generated this error.
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/execution_order4.png' />

As we generate more sophisticated code you'll see that we try to keep the 
number of mandatory blocks in our code to a minimum.  In fact, we should never
have more than two!

Keep this in  mind for now.  It will become highly relevant when you start
working on your projects.
