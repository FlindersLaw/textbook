title: Complex Data Recap

import {DisplayGlossaryItem} from '@site/src/components';

This chapter has introduced you to one of the more complex, but very powerful, areas of coding.

We started out with the notion of storing more than one piece of data in a variable and then
expanded this to <DisplayGlossaryItem item='list' plural /> and <DisplayGlossaryItem item='dictionary' plural />.

From there we introduced and explored the concept of <DisplayGlossaryItem item='iteration' />.  
Iteration is one of the most powerful coding concepts we explore in this book and has the 
potential to significantly reduce the amount of code you write.

We discussed how iteration and lists go hand-in-hand, so much so that we will often go out of our
way to structure data in list form so that we can iterate over it.

We then discussed how complex data structures can be nested into each other.  More specifically,
we discussed how list items can contain complex data structures and how a list of dictionaries
is a very useful and often-used way of storing table-like, or two-dimensional, data.

We also discussed <DisplayGlossaryItem item='datablock' plural /> and how they can be used to store
data as a basic database in Docassemble.

We then expanded this discussion to include multidimensional data, that is mutliple levels of
nested complex data structures.  We used the [iRefer](https://docassemble.flinders.edu.au/interview?i=docassemble.LLAW33012020S1P02:data/questions/main_code2.yml#page1)
app as an example and did a deep dive into a subset of its data.  We used the example to show 
a data block which contained a complex data structure containing a list of dictionaries, with some
dictionary elements themselves containing lists.  We explored the benefits of multi-dimensional
data structures and their ability to store information in a more easily accessible way than, say
a two-dimensional table.

Finally, we looked at an example of filtering out unwanted records.  We used our iRefer example
and wrote code to display only agencies that catered for 'Behaviour management services'.

Manipluating data is one of the most complex yet most powerful aspects of coding generally.  
This chapter provides an introduction to working with data.  Docassemble has other powerful
data manipulation tools such as [objects](https://docassemble.org/docs/objects.html),
[groups](https://docassemble.org/docs/groups.html), and
[table blocks](https://docassemble.org/docs/initial.html#table).  You are encouraged to read
the Docassemble manual to find out more information about these concepts.
