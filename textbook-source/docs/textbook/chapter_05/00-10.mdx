We already know that we can store stuff in variables.  For example, we can store:

<table id="complexDataTable1">
    <tr>
        <th>Strings</th>
        <td><code>MJFname = 'Mark Ferraretto'</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Integers</th>
        <td><code>MJFnumber_chn = 4</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Floats</th>
        <td><code>MJFhh_income = 45000.0</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Booleans</th>
        <td><code>MJFis_citizen = True</code></td>
    </tr>
</table>

What each example has in common is that each stores one piece of information ie:
 
* one string;
* one integer;
* one floating point number; and
* one boolean.

Sometimes, though, we might have data that looks like this:
<table className="complexDataTableExamples cdtCentre">
    <caption>A list of names</caption>
    <tr><th>Name</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Ida Noe</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Hugo First</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Moda Lawn</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Kate Jupp</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ayfor Gott</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Justin Thyme</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ray Member</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Studie Harde</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Slacke Hearse</td></tr>
</table>

or this:

<table className="complexDataTableExamples cdtCentre">
    <tr><th>Name</th> <th>Number of Children</th> <th>Household Income</th> <th>Is a Citizen?</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Hugo First</td><td>4</td><td>$45,000</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Moda Lawn</td><td>4</td><td>$45,000</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Kate Jupp</td><td>4</td><td>$45,000</td><td>No</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ayfor Gott</td><td>4</td><td>$45,000</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Justin Thyme</td><td>4</td><td>$45,000</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ray Member</td><td>4</td><td>$45,000</td><td>No</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Studie Harde</td><td>4</td><td>$45,000</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Slack Hearse</td><td>4</td><td>$45,000</td><td>Yes</td></tr>
</table>

How do we store this data?  For example, let's look at our list of names above.

One way would be to store each name in a variable.  We know we can store strings in variables,
so maybe we could set up variables as follows:
```python 
MJFname1 = 'Ida Noe'
MJFname2 = 'Hugo First'
MJFname3 = 'Moda Lawn'
MJFname4 = 'Kate Jupp'
MJFname5 = 'Ayfor Gott'
MJFname6 = 'Justin Thyme'
MJFname7 = 'Ray Member'
MJFname8 = 'Studie Harde'
MJFname9 = 'Slacke Hearse'
```
Technically this works, but it raises some issues:

    align='left' size='20%' />

First, it's not going to scale very well.  Imagine needing to manage a list of 100, or 1,000 names.
We'd need 100 or 1,000 variables.  This is a lot of work and, specifically, a lot
of *repetitive* work. It's inefficient, time-consuming and error-prone.

 Wouldn't it be nice if we could store all these names in 
a single variable regardless of how many we had...

Also, how would we manage displaying all the names?  For example, how would we display the list
above?  We'd have to list out each <code>MJFname<i>N</i></code>
variable each time.  What happens when we add or 
delete someone?  We need to create new variables and copy them throughout our code.  When we
delete names we'd have gaps in our sequencing.  How would we know the gap is there on purpose
and not an error? 

<DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/chapter_05/happywomanwithbucket.png'
    align='right' size='15%' />
This is unworkable, much like carrying 10 buckets around each with one thing inside, when what
you really want is to carry one bucket around with 10 things inside.

If only we had a way of displaying all the names using a single variable and
just added and removed names from it as we needed to.

If only we could be as happy as the Happy Bucket Lady...

## Introducing Complex Data Structures
Complex data types are the answer to our problem.  Complex
data types, such as <DisplayGlossaryItem item='list' plural /> and
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='dictionary' plural /> give us  Happy Bucket Lady
vibes.  This is because complex data types allow us to store more than one value in 
a variable.  Even more so, complex data types also allow us to structure how we will store
the data.  For example, a list complex data type allows us to store data in sequential order,
much like that 'List of names' table above.  Because complex data type allow us to do this,
they are often also referred to as **complex data structures**.  We will use both terms 
interchangeably in this textbook.
