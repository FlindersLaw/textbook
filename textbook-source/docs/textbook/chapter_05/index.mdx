In <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_03' /> we discussed 'simple', or 'fundamental', 
data types, such as integers, strings and booleans.  In this chapter we'll discuss
more complex data types.  These data types allow you to collect simple data types
together in a more complex, and more useful, data structure.

For example, let's say we want to collect information about a community legal centre
(**CLC**).  There's lots of information that pertains to a CLC, for example:

- its name (a string);
- its address (string);
- contact email (string);
- contact phone (string); and
- the number of employees it has (integer).

:::note Phone numbers are strings
You might initially think it would be best to collect a phone number as an integer as,
after all, a phone number (0401234567) is an integer.  However, it's better to collect
phone numbers as strings.  This allows us to embed formatting using spaces
(eg: 0401 234 567) and country codes (eg: +61 401 234 567) into the phone number.
:::

We can collect all that information with a set of string variable and an integer variable,
but what we'd really like to do is represent that all these otherwise independent variables
all relate to the same CLC.

Let's also say that instead of collecting this information about just one CLC we want to
collect this information about all the CLCs operating in South Australia.  We might do
this for an app that directs a user to the appropriate CLC depending on their Location
and other circumstances.

[Here is an example](https://dev.dll.org.au/da/interview?i=docassemble.CLCSA01ServiceDirectory:data/questions/main.yml#page1)
of just such an app developed for Community Legal Centres SA (**CLCSA**) in 2020.

This is where complex data types, such as <DisplayGlossaryItem item='dictionary' plural />,
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='list' plural /> and <DisplayGlossaryItem item='object' plural />
come into play.  We can use these datatypes to group related data together.  This makes
our data much easier to manage and also more logical to deal with.

Let's get going.
