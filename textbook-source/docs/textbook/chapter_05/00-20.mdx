## Introducing Lists
Let's define a **list** to mean this:

1. The list must have a name
2. The list must have items
3. We can refer to an item by its position in the list (ie: first item, second item, last item)

Let's re-visit that table of names we had before:
<table className="complexDataTableExamples">
    <tr><th>Name</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Ida Noe</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Hugo First</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Moda Lawn</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Kate Jupp</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ayfor Gott</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Justin Thyme</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ray Member</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Studie Harde</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Slacke Harse</td></tr>
</table>
From this table we can see that:

1. it has a name (which happens to be **Name**);
2. it has items - nine items to be precise; and
3. the only way to refer to items is by their order (eg: 'Ayfor Gott' is the fifth item in the list).

That makes our table a **list**, as it has all three properties of a list.

We can express our list in Python like so:
```python
Name = [
    'Ida Noe',
    'Hugo First',
    'Moda Lawn',
    'Kate Jupp',
    'Ayfor Gott',
    'Justin Thyme',
    'Ray Member',
    'Studie Harde',
    'Slacke Hearse'
]
```
A Python list consists of the following:
1. a variable name, to which the list is assigned (the name of the list);
1. items separated by commas (`,`);
1. square brackets (`[` and `]`) which indicate the start and the end of the list respectively; and
1 (as we shall see), each item is accessed by referring to its position in the list.

:::info
Each item in a list does not need to be on a separate line.  It's the commas (`,`) that separate
one item from another.  We could have expressed our `Name` list as follows:
```python
Name = [ 'Ida Noe', 'Hugo First', 'Moda Lawn', 'Kate Jupp', 'Ayfor Gott', 'Justin Thyme', 'Ray Member', 'Studie Harde', 'Slacke Hearse' ]
```
This is also valid syntax but it's much harder to read (not to mention on small screens it
requires a bit of scrolling).

<Quizlet>
    Which of the following is a Python list?
    <Answer>
    ```python
    shopping_list = 'apples, pears and oranges'
    ```
    </Answer>
    <Answer>
    ```python
    to_do_list [ 
        'study hard'
        'go on a holiday'
        'study some more'
        'graduate'
    ]
    ```
    </Answer>
    <Answer isCorrect>
    ```python
    family_I_like = [
        'Mum',
        'Dad',
        'Uncle Kenny',
        'Aunt Jemima'
    ]
    ```
    </Answer>
    <Explanation correctAnswer>
    Correct!

    All three answers have a variable name, but only this answer has:

    * square brackets that open and close the list; and
    * list items seprated by commas.

## Accessing (or 'Referencing') Items in a List
