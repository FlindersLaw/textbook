## Introducing Lists
Let's define a **list** to mean this:

1. The list must have a name
2. The list must have items
3. We can refer to an item by its position in the list (ie: first item, second item, last item)

Let's re-visit that table of names we had before:
<table className="complexDataTableExamples">
    <tr><th>Student Names</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Ida Noe</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Hugo First</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Moda Lawn</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Kate Jupp</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ayfor Gott</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Justin Thyme</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ray Member</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Studie Harde</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Slacke Harse</td></tr>
</table>
From this table we can see that:

1. it has a name (which happens to be **Student Names**);
2. it has items - nine items to be precise; and
3. the only way to refer to items is by their order (eg: 'Ayfor Gott' is the fifth item in the list).

That makes our table a **list**, as it has all three properties of a list.

## Python List Properties

We can express our list in Python like so:
```python
student_names = [
    'Ida Noe',
    'Hugo First',
    'Moda Lawn',
    'Kate Jupp',
    'Ayfor Gott',
    'Justin Thyme',
    'Ray Member',
    'Studie Harde',
    'Slacke Hearse'
]
```
A Python list consists of the following:
1. a variable name, to which the list is assigned (the name of the list);
1. items separated by commas (`,`);
1. square brackets (`[` and `]`) which indicate the start and the end of the list respectively; and
1 (as we shall see), each item is accessed by referring to its position in the list.

:::info
Each item in a list does not need to be on a separate line.  It's the commas (`,`) that separate
one item from another.  We could have expressed our `Name` list as follows:
```python
student_names = [ 'Ida Noe', 'Hugo First', 'Moda Lawn', 'Kate Jupp', 'Ayfor Gott', 'Justin Thyme', 'Ray Member', 'Studie Harde', 'Slacke Hearse' ]
```
This is also valid syntax but it's much harder to read (not to mention on small screens it
requires a bit of scrolling).
:::

:::info
Variables can't have spaces in their names.  Conseuently, we could not call our list variable
`Student Names` to match the name on the table.  As a convention, we usually do two things:

1. Express variable names in lower case (unless using an anagram or initials); and
1. replace spaces with underscores (`_`).

That results in 'Student Names' becoming `student_names` in Python.

## Accessing (or 'Referencing') Items in a List {#referencing}
As we've already said, one of the properties of a list is that the items it contains are 
referred to by their position in the list.  Ida is the first item, Ayfor is fifth and 
Slacke is last.

We could also say that Ida is at position number 1, Ayfor at position 5 and Slacke at 
position 9.

In Python we use a number to indicate position **with one important caveat**.  Python starts
counting from zero.  Consequently, according to Python, Ida is at position 0, Ayfor at position 4
and Slacke at position 8.

<table className="complexDataTableExamples">
    <tr>
        <th>Student Names</th>
        <td>What we say</td>
        <td>What Python thinks</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Ida Noe</td>
        <td>First item</td>
        <td>
            <code>student_names[0]</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Hugo First</td>
        <td>Second item</td>
        <td>
            <code>student_names[1]</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Moda Lawn</td>
        <td>Third item</td>
        <td>
            <code>student_names[2]</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Kate Jupp</td>
        <td>Fourth item</td>
        <td>
            <code>student_names[3]</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Ayfor Gott</td>
        <td>Fifth item</td>
        <td>
            <code>student_names[4]</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Justin Thyme</td>
        <td>Sixth item</td>
        <td>
            <code>student_names[5]</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Ray Member</td>
        <td>Seventh item</td>
        <td>
            <code>student_names[6]</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Studie Harde</td>
        <td>Eigth item</td>
        <td>
            <code>student_names[7]</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Slacke Hearse</td>
        <td>Ninth item</td>
        <td>
            <code>student_names[8]</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

You can see from the table above that they way we access an item in a list, or **reference**
an item in a list, is by using the list's name with brackets and a position indicator, or **index**.
```python
student_names[1]
```
The above example accesses the second item in the list called `Name`.

Almost all programming languages count their list items starting from zero.

## More List properties
We hae already learnt that:
1. Python lists have a name, which is the variable name the list is assigned to;
1. lists have items, which are enclosed in square brackets (`[]`); and
1. we reference an item by its position in the list, but starting from zero.

Lists have a number of other properties as well.  We will cover some of them here.

### List length
You can use the `len()` Python <DisplayGlossaryItem item='function' />
to query how long a list is.  You do this by 
inserting the list name into `len()`.  For example, `len(student_names)` gives us the length
of `student_names`.  If we were interested in keeping the length for future use,
we'd assign it to a variable like so:
```python
list_length = len(student_names)
```
The value of `list_length`, given our list above, would be **9**.

:::note
You'll find that you'll use `len()` quite a bit, especially when iterating over a list.  We
will cover <DisplayGlossaryItem item='iteration' /> in
<DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_06'/>.
:::

### Adding and deleting items
Just like a spreadsheet (or a bucket!), we can add items to a list and we can also delete items
from a list.

#### Adding
To add an item to the list we use the `append()` <DisplayGlossaryItem item='method' />.  For
example, let's add a new student, Stew Penous, to our `student_names` list:
```python
student_names.append('Stew Pendous')
```
After running this command, Stew is added to the end (or 'appended') to our list.  It now
looks like this:
```python
student_names = [
    'Ida Noe',
    'Hugo First',
    'Moda Lawn',
    'Kate Jupp',
    'Ayfor Gott',
    'Justin Thyme',
    'Ray Member',
    'Studie Harde',
    'Slacke Hearse',
    'Stew Pendous'
]
```
`len(student_names)` would now return **10**

#### Deleting
The `del()` Python function deletes list items.  We delete an item by referencing it inside
the `del()` function.  For example, if we wanted to delete Ray from the list we'd run this
command: 
```python
del(student_names[6])  # Ray is the 7th item in the list
```

This code allows the user to select an  item from `student_names` to delete and deletes it.
It then shows the truncated list to the user.

# This code displays the items in a list and allows the user to 
# select an item to delete. It then deletes the item and re-displays

  # Here's a trap for new players. When a user selects an item to delete,
  # the index (ie: the position in the list) is stored in our item_to_delete
  # variable - **as a string**.  Consequently, we can't just call 
  # del(student_names[item_to_delete]) to delete the array item. What we need
  # to do is convert (or **cast**) item_to_delete from a string to an integer.
  # Luckily there's a function for that - int().  So, what we'll do is wrap
  # item_to_delete in int() and put that into our del() function.
  del(student_names[int(item_to_delete)])
  
  # Whew! That was complicated!  Lucky this last line is easy peasy.  Just
  # call the final screen.
  final_screen

# We define student_names in this code block

  student_names = [

    'Slacke Hearse'
  ]
---
# When the user selects an item in the radio buttons
# to delete, we need to record the position of that item and
# not the value of the item itself.  That's because, unlike 
# append(), del() takes an reference to a list item's position
# instead of a value. Eg: to delete the third item in student_names
# we need to call del(student_names[2]) and not del(student_names['Moda Lawn'])
# This code block is used by the first screen to match up each value (which the user sees)
# with its index, which we will then pass to the del() command in the 
# second mandatory block
code: |
  first_screen_radio_choices = []
  # Once again, we use iteration to examine every list item in turn
  # This 'for loop' starts by setting the value of i to 0 and increments
  # it by 1 each time it runs until it gets to one less than
  # the number of items in student_names.  That's useful for us because if
  # student_names has 9 items in it, we want i to run from 0 to 8.
  for i in range(0,len(student_names)):
    first_screen_radio_choices.append({ i : student_names[i] })

:::info
In practice we append items to lists more often than we delete items.  In fact, a common
way to define a list is to start out with an empty list eg:
```python
bread_types = []
```
and then append items to it one by one eg:
```python
bread_types.append('sourdough',)
bread_types.append('croissant',)
bread_types.append('tip top',)
bread_types.append('artisan',)
bread_types.append('chocolate')
```
or, as in the example code, use <DisplayGlossaryItem item='iteration' /> to do the
same thing.

    `del()` is the function you use to delete items from a list.  You need to specify the
    name of the list and its index inside the `del()` function.  Counting for indices
    starts at zero, not 1.  So, as `tip top` is the third item, its index is `2`.

## List membership
Python allows you to test if an element can be found in a list.  For example,
you may want to check to see if Ray exists in our `student_names` list.  To
do so you use Python's `in` operator like so:
```python
'Ray Member' in student_names
```
This is usually used as part of an <DisplayGlossaryItem item='ifstatement' />,
for example:
```python
if 'Ray Member' in student_names:
  congratulate_ray
else:
  commiserate_with_ray
```
In our example congratulations will be offered to Ray on account of his
inclusion in our `student_names` list.

You can also use the `not in` operator, which tests to see if an item
is *not* in the list ie:
```python
if 'Mark Joseph' not in student_names:
  mark_is_jealous
else:
  mark_is_delirious
```
Mark, unfortunately, may need to seek help with his feelings of envy on
account of his exclusion from `student_names`.

## Next
Now that you've been introduced to lists, its time to move on to the one of the most powerful
things you can do with them - **iteration**.
