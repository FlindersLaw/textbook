## Introducing Lists
Let's define a **list** to mean this:

1. The list must have a name
2. The list must have items
3. We can refer to an item by its position in the list (ie: first item, second item, last item)

Let's re-visit that table of names we had before:
<table className="complexDataTableExamples">
    <tr><th>Student Names</th></tr>
    <tr><td>Ida Noe</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Hugo First</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Moda Lawn</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Kate Jupp</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ayfor Gott</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Justin Thyme</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Ray Member</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Studie Harde</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Slacke Harse</td></tr>
</table>
From this table we can see that:

1. it has a name (which happens to be **Name**);
2. it has items - nine items to be precise; and
3. the only way to refer to items is by their order (eg: 'Ayfor Gott' is the fifth item in the list).

That makes our table a **list**, as it has all three properties of a list.

We can express our list in Python like so:
```python
student_names = [
    'Ida Noe',
    'Hugo First',
    'Moda Lawn',
    'Kate Jupp',
    'Ayfor Gott',
    'Justin Thyme',
    'Ray Member',
    'Studie Harde',
    'Slacke Hearse'
]
```
A Python list consists of the following:
1. a variable name, to which the list is assigned (the name of the list);
1. items separated by commas (`,`);
1. square brackets (`[` and `]`) which indicate the start and the end of the list respectively; and
1 (as we shall see), each item is accessed by referring to its position in the list.

:::info
Each item in a list does not need to be on a separate line.  It's the commas (`,`) that separate
one item from another.  We could have expressed our `Name` list as follows:
```python
student_names = [ 'Ida Noe', 'Hugo First', 'Moda Lawn', 'Kate Jupp', 'Ayfor Gott', 'Justin Thyme', 'Ray Member', 'Studie Harde', 'Slacke Hearse' ]
```
This is also valid syntax but it's much harder to read (not to mention on small screens it
requires a bit of scrolling).
:::

:::info
Variables can't have spaces in their names.  Conseuently, we could not call our list variable
`Student Names` to match the name on the table.  As a convention, we usually do two things:

1. Express variable names in lower case (unless using an anagram or initials); and
1. replace spaces with underscores (`_`).

That results in 'Student Names' becoming `student_names` in Python.

        'Aunt Jemima'
    ]
    ```
    </Answer>
    <Explanation correctAnswer>
    Correct!

    All three answers have a variable name, but only this answer has:

    * square brackets that open and close the list; and
    * list items seprated by commas.

## Accessing (or 'Referencing') Items in a List
As we've already said, one of the properties of a list is that the items it contains are 
referred to by their position in the list.  Ida is the first item, Ayfor is fifth and 
Slacke is last.

We could also say that Ida is at position number 1, Ayfor at position 5 and Slacke at 
position 9.

In Python we use a number to indicate position **with one important caveat**.  Python starts
counting from zero.  Consequently, according to Python, Ida is at position 0, Ayfor at position 4
and Slacke at position 8.

<table className="complexDataTableExamples">
    <tr>
        <th>Student Names</th>
        <td>What we say</td>
        <td>What Python thinks</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Ida Noe</td>
        <td>First item</td>
        <td>
            <code>student_names[0]</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Hugo First</td>
        <td>Second item</td>
        <td>
            <code>student_names[1]</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Moda Lawn</td>
        <td>Third item</td>
        <td>
            <code>student_names[2]</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Kate Jupp</td>
        <td>Fourth item</td>
        <td>
            <code>student_names[3]</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Ayfor Gott</td>
        <td>Fifth item</td>
        <td>
            <code>student_names[4]</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Justin Thyme</td>
        <td>Sixth item</td>
        <td>
            <code>student_names[5]</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Ray Member</td>
        <td>Seventh item</td>
        <td>
            <code>student_names[6]</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Studie Harde</td>
        <td>Eigth item</td>
        <td>
            <code>student_names[7]</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Slacke Harse</td>
        <td>Ninth item</td>
        <td>
            <code>student_names[8]</code>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

You can see from the table above that they way we access an item in a list, or **reference**
an item in a list, is by using the list's name with brackets and a position indicator, or **index**.
```python
student_names[1]
```
The above example accesses the second item in the list called `Name`.

Almost all programming languages count their list items starting from zero.

## More List properties
We hae already learnt that:
1. Python lists have a name, which is the variable name the list is assigned to;
1. lists have items, which are enclosed in square brackets (`[]`); and
1. we reference an item by its position in the list, but starting from zero.

Lists have a number of other properties as well.  We will cover some of them here.

### List length
You can use the `len()` Python function to query how long a list is.  You do this by 
inserting the list name into `len()`.  For example, `len(student_names) gives us the length
of `student_names`.  If we were interested in keeping the length, we'd assign it to a variable
like so:
```python
list_length = len(student_names)
```
The value of `list_length` would be **9**.

:::note
You'll find that you'll use `len()` quite a bit, especially when iterating over a list.  We
will cover <DisplayGlossaryItem item='iteration' /> in
<DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_06'/>.

### Adding and deleting items
Just like a spreadsheet (or a bucket!), we can add items to a list and we can also delete items
from a list.

#### Adding
To add an item to the list we use the `append()` <DisplayGlossaryItem item='method' />.  For
example, let's add a new student, Stew Penous, to our `student_names` list:
```python
student_names.append('Stew Pendous')
```
After running this command, Stew is added to the end (or 'appended') to our list.  It now
looks like this:
```python
student_names = [
    'Ida Noe',
    'Hugo First',
    'Moda Lawn',
    'Kate Jupp',
    'Ayfor Gott',
    'Justin Thyme',
    'Ray Member',
    'Studie Harde',
    'Slacke Hearse',
    'Stew Pendous'
]
```
`len(student_names)` would now return **10**


### Deleting
The `del()` Python function deletes list items.  We delete an item by referencing it inside
the `del()` function.  For example, if we wanted to delete Ray from the list we'd run this
command: 
```python
del(student_names[6])  # Ray is the 7th item in the list
```
:::info
In practice we append items to lists more often than we delete items.  In fact, a common
way to define a list is to start out with an empty list eg:
```python
bread_types = []
```
and then append items to it one by one eg:
```python
bread_types.append('sourdough',)
bread_types.append('croissant',)
bread_types.append('tip top',)
bread_types.append('artisan',)
bread_types.append('chocolate')
```
