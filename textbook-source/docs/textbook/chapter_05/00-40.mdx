## Introducing Dictionaries
A dictionary in Python is defined as a data structure that allows you to look up a value by reference
to a 'key'.  The name 'dictionary' is used because dictionaries as we know them
work in a similar way.  In a regular dictionary, the 'key' is the word being looked up, and the 'value'
is the definition of that word.  Every single definition in a regular dictionary is mapped to one key, 
and every key points to one definition.  It's a one-to-one mapping in that sense.

Python dictionaries are the same.  Every item in a dictionary is comprised of a key, which is unique
in the dictionary, and a value which the key points to.

Why is this useful?

We have already seen how Python lists allow us to group ordered lists of data into a single data structure.
However, data is not always ordered sequentially.  We may instead want to access data based on 
what the data is.  A good example of this would be accessing personal details for a person.

For example, let's say we have this information about me:

<table className="complexDataTableExamples cdtLeft">
    <tr>
        <th>First Name</th>
        <td>Mark</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Last Name</th>
        <td>Ferraretto</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Email</th>
        <td>mark@f.com</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Phone</th>
        <td>08 1234 5678</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Expressing this data in a list eg:
```python
user_details = [
    'Mark',
    'Ferraretto',
    'mark@f.com',
    '08 1234 5678'
]
```
is not that useful to us.  I can remember that my first name is at
index 0 and last name at index 1 and so-on but those indices don't really
shed any light on the values they store.  What's more, we're not really after
the utility of a list here.  That is, this is not the type of data we'd iterate over.

What would be more useful to us would be a data structure that, instead of using
numerical indices, used a desriptive 'key' to access each value.  For example,
istead of accessing my last name by typing
```python
user_details[1]
```
it would be more descriptive if I could use, say,
```python
user_details['Last Name']
```
This is exactly what Python dictionaries do.  Each item in a dictionary
is asigned a unique key which points to a value.  Or, to put it another way,
each item in a dictionary consists of a **key/value pair**.

We can express my user details in a Python dictionary like so:
```python
user_details = {
    'first_name' : 'Mark',
    'last_name'  : 'Ferraretto',
    'email'      : 'mark@f.com',
    'phone'      : '08 1234 5678'
}
```
You can see the syntax has some simliarities to the list syntax but there
are significant differnces:

Firstly, the list's square brackets (`[]`) are replaced by **braces** (`{}`).

Secondly, the items in the dictionary are laid out sequentially, like a list. 
However, each item consists of a key/value pair separated by a colon (`:`)

:::note
#### A number of things to be mindful of

The most important is not to confuse square brackets and braces.  Doing so
can lead to errors or, even worse, unexpected behaviour.  Always be clear that
lists are surrounded by square brackets (`[...]`) and dictionaries are surrounded
by bracces (`{...}`).

Second, you can see we modified the keys by changing the table text into
lower case and replacing spaces with underscores (eg: 'First Name' --> `first_name`).
While not required, the custom with Python dictionaries is to have the key
all in lower case and without spaces.  However, `First Name` is a perfectly
valid key.

Third, in our example, we padded out the space between the key and the
colon (`:`) so that all the colons line up one under another.  We've done
this for cosmetic reasons only.  The code looks nicer! And it's easier to read.

Fourth, some of you may notice that, apart from being key/value pairs, the 
items in a dictionary are set out much like a list (ie: in sequence).  Does that
mean we can iterate over them?  The short answer is yes, but there are caveats.
We will cover these caveats [later in this chapter](#iteration).
:::

## Referencing
Referencing works in a similar way to [referencing in lists](./00-20#referecing).
Instead of a numeric index, we use the the name of the key.  So,
```
user_details['first_name']
```
will give us the value `Mark`.

:::note
You cannot reference, say, the first item in the dictionary by typing
`user_details[0]`.  This will yield an error as Python will attempt to look 
for a key called `0` in your dictionary and the lookup will fail.

You can only lookup a value by its keys.
:::

## Initialising dictionaries
Much like lists, we can either start with an empty dictionary:
```python
user_details = {}
```
or we can initialise a dictionary with variables:
```python
user_details = {
    'first_name' : 'Mark',
    'last_name'  : 'Ferraretto',
    'email'      : 'mark@f.com',
    'phone'      : '08 1234 5678'
}
```
Note the use of braces (`{}`) instead of square brackets.

## Adding items
Once a dictionary is initialised, items can be added to them simply by
assigning a new value to a new key.  For example, we can add details about
my office to `user_details` by specifing what we want the value of the `office`
key to be:
```python
user_details['office'] = 'LWCM Room 10'
```
This adds the `office` key to `user_details` and assigns it the value
`LWCM Room 10`.  Our `user_details` dictionary would subsequently look like this:
```python
user_details = {
    'first_name' : 'Mark',
    'last_name'  : 'Ferraretto',
    'email'      : 'mark@f.com',
    'phone'      : '08 1234 5678',
    'office'     : 'LWCM Room 10'
}
```
:::note
You must initialise a dictionary before you can add items to it
:::

## Deleting Items
Deleting key/value pairs works in way very similar to
[deleting list items](./00-20#deleting), that is by using `del()`.  
With dictionaries the name of the key is supplied instead of a numerical index.

To delete the `phone` key/value pair from `user_details` we would do this:
```python
del(user_details['phone'])
```

## List-like properties of dictionaries
Although a dictionary is not a list, it does have some list-like properties.
For example, you can find the length of a dictionary, you can iterate over its
keys and you can check a key exists in a dictionary (but not a value).

This list-like properties come about because, internally, Python treats 
the keys as a list in many circumstances.  The most obvious of these is
the `keys()` <DisplayGlossaryItem item='method' /> which returns a list
of the keys in the dictionary ie this:
```python
user_details.keys()
```
returns this list:
```python
['first_name', 'last_name', 'email', 'phone', 'office']
```
The other list-like functions and methods essentially operate on this
list of keys.

### Length
Like lists, you can use `len()` to count the number of items in a dictionary.
`len()` actually counts the number of keys, but this is sufficient to return
the number of items as each key can only have one value.

This command:
```python
len(user_details)
```
would return **5**, as we have five key/value pairs in `user_details`.

### Membership
We can use `in` and `not in` with dictionaries in a similiar way as we do
for [lists](00-20#list-membership).  However, `in` and `not in` only work
with keys and with values.  So, this:
```python
'first_name' in user_details
```
would return `True`, but this:
```python
'Mark' in user_details
```
would result in an error.

:::tip
Using `in` is a good way to find if a key exists in a dictionary.  It's
a good precautionary check to make before getting the value of a key as it
prevents your program crashing if your key doesn't exist.
:::

### Iteration
We've spoken about iteration [already](00-30). Iteration and lists are 
a potent combination.

We can also iterate over a dictionary or, more specifically, over the keys
of a dictionary.

:::note
In theory, a dictionary has no order.  That meant that when iterating over
a dictionary you would never know the order in which the key/value pairs
would be displayed.  However, Docassemble preserves the order of keys, 
meaning that when we iterate over a dictionary the key/value pairs will
always be presented in the order they are added to the dictionary.
:::

We will usually use the `keys()` method for iteration.  Here is some 
example code that displays a Markdown table, uses a Mako `%for` loop
to iterate over `user_details` (highlighted),
and prints out the rows of the table:
```yml showLineNumbers
---
mandatory: True
question: User details table
subquestion: |

  Key|Value
  ---|---
  # highlight-start
  %for item in user_details.keys():
  `${item}`|${user_details[item]}
  %endfor
  # highlight-end
---
code: |
  user_details = {
    'first_name' : 'Mark',
    'last_name'  : 'Ferraretto',
    'email'      : 'mark@f.com',
    'phone'      : '08 1234 5678',
    'office'     : 'LWCM Room 10'
  }
---
```

## An example implementation
This example code allows a user to add an extra key/value pair to 
`user_details` and displays `user_details` in a table.
The code then checks to see if the key added matches a secret key.  If
it does, then the secret key is displayed, otherwise a message stating
that the secret key was not guessed is displayed.

This code provides examples of:

* initialising a dictionary
* adding a key/value pair to a dictionary
* iterating over a dictionary; and
* testing for membership.

The code is well commented (in the author's opinion!) and you are enouraged
to read through the comments and the code.  You are also encouraged to
copy the code into your Playground and experiment with it.
