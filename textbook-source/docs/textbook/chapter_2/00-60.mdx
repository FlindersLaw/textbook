title: Vital Statistics - A More Sophisticated Example
---
import * as Constants from '@site/src/constants'
import * as Components from '@site/src/components'

We've learnt lots of things over this chapter.  We can write code!  We can also:
*  ask questions;
* use <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='markdown' upper /> to format and 
display text;
* we know the difference between <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='mandatoryblock' plural />
and regular <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='questionblock' plural />;
* We can use tables to set out our final screens;
* We can present choices in a drop-down; and
* We can create custom word and PDF documents based on the answers we receive.

The code below is for an app called 'Vital Statistics'.  It presents some important
information about the user and in the process makes more use of what we have
learnt so far.  The code uses a lot of what we have learnt over the course of
this chapter and also introduces a few new concepts.  Let's work through it.

### Lines 30 to 33
We're starting at line 30 because this is where some of the new concepts are.
If you read through lines 1 to 29 you'll see a mandatory question block that
looks very similar to our [Hello World 5](./00-50) example.  The table has
different information (and we'll come back to that) but otherwise this code
is very similar to `hello_world5.yml`.

Let's look at lines 30 to 33
```yaml
question: How old are you?
fields:
  - no label: MJFage
    datatype: integer
```
First, we have [seen `no label` before](./00-30#the-second-question-block).
What we haven't seen however is line 30:
```yaml
    dataype: integer
```
Firstly, we can see that the word `datatype` is aligned with `no label`.  You'll
recall that line 29 has the dash-label-variable format that we have seen 
[before](./00-42#presenting-choices-in-a-question) and which 'declares' a
variable.  That is, line 29 is telling Docassemble how to ask a question so
we can get a value for a variable, `MJFage` in this case.

Line 30, because of the alignment and the lack of a dash, is tied to line 29.
Line 30 is giving us more information about variable declared at line 29.
We say that line 30 *describes*, or *modifies*,
the variable declaration at line 29.

Line 30 is sets the 'data type' of the variable `MJFage` to be an integer.

:::info What is a Data Type?
As we said [early on](./00-20#variables), `MJFage` is a variable and we 
can 'put stuff in' a variable.  By stuff we mean data.  **We store data
in a variable**.

We can have different types of data.  Up until now we have been storing text,
or <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='string' plural /> in our variables.
Strings are the default data type.  There are also other data types, as we'll
see as we work our way through this textbook.

Line 30 sets the data type to be an **integer**.
An [**integer** data type](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#numbers)
allows us to store whole numbers only (ie: 1, 2,
3, 4 etc).  We can't store a string in an integer data type.  If we do we'll
get an error:
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_2/vitalstatistics-1.png' />

Using a data type can be useful to control, or *validate* the input a user
enters.  In our case, we are forcing the user to enter a number and not words
into this text box.  This could come in handy later if we, say, wanted to 
check the number was bigger or smaller than another number.  For example, we
might want to check the age to make sure a user is over 18 years old and
therefore an adult.
:::

### Lines 37 to 41
```yaml
  - Are you employed?: MJFisemployed
    datatype: radio
    choices:
      - Yes
      - No
```
Here we again see a variable declaration at line 37, with a `datatype` modifier
at line 38.  This time, the data type is `radio`.
A [radio data type](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#radio) presents
a list of choices to the user and requires them to select only one choice.
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_2/vitalstatistics-2.png' />

This means only the values `Yes` or `No` can be placed into `MJFisemployed`.

:::note
`Yes` and `No` are <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='string' /> values.
As we'll see further in this text book, when we want to ask a 'yes or no' 
question, a better way to do so is to use a <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='boolean' />
data type.
:::

### Lines 42 to 46
```yaml
  - What is your {income}?: MJFannualincome
    datatype: currency
    show if: 
      variable: MJFisemployed
      is: 'Yes'
```
We will discuss the braces (`{}`) in line 42 in the next section.

#### Line 43
We've seen two different `datatype`s so far and line 43 introduces a third: 
`currency`.  The [currency](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#currency)
data type is used, unsurprisingly, to display money amounts.  It forces the
user to enter a number with two or more digits after the decimal point.  If
more than two digits are entered, they are rounded up to two digits, so that
this:
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_2/vitalstatistics-4.png' />
Is rounded to this:
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_2/vitalstatistics-5.png' />

Just like the `integer` data type, it is not possible to enter non-integer 
values, such as characters:
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_2/vitalstatistics-6.png' />
or even the dollar sign!
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_2/vitalstatistics-7.png' />

#### Line 44
Line 44, like line 43 above it, are aligned with the label on line 42.  As 
[already discussed](./00-60#lines-30-to-33), this means that line 44 modifies
line 42.  In this case, the [`show if` statement](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#show%20if)
tells Docassemble only to 
display Line 42 if the criteria set out on lines 45 and 46 are met.

#### Line 45
This is the first part of the criterion.  The `variable:` tag tells Docassemble
that it must check the value of the variable (in this case `MJFisemployed`).

#### Line 46
This tells Docassemble what the value of the variable specified in line 45 should
contain.  Line 46 is saying that value should be `Yes`.

Therefore, lines 44, 45 and 46 together tell Docassemble that the variable set
out on line 42 should only be displayed if the value of `MJFisemployed` is set
to `Yes`.  If we select the `Yes` radio button, we can see that the question
is automatically displayed:
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_2/vitalstatistics-8.png' />
and if we select `No` for `MJFisemployed` then the question is hidden:
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_2/vitalstatistics-9.png' />

This is a good way of displaying to a user only the relevant questions in an
application.

:::caution
Using `show if` is a great way to control what information is displayed to 
a user.  In this app if the user is not employed and so there is no point asking
them for their income. Using `show if` is an effective way of hiding the income
question in a context where it would be redundant.

**However**, what happens if, in your final screen, you decide to display a
value for `MJFannualincome` if a user says they are not employed?

Copy the code into your playground, run it and see what happens.  We'll cover
this issue further down this page.
:::

### Lines 42 and 47 to 49
```yaml
  - What is your {income}?: MJFannualincome
...
terms:
  income: |
    Your income should be your gross (ie: before tax) income
```
The braces (`{}`) surrounding the word `income` tell Docassemble to look for 
a [term](https://docassemble.org/docs/modifiers.html#terms).  Terms are used
to display pop-up text when the word is clicked on:
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_2/vitalstatistics-3.png' />

Terms are a great way to display pop-up help text.

### Lines 55 to 63
```yaml
  - no label: MJFhobbies
    datatype: checkboxes
    choices:
      - Flying
      - Running
      - Playing music
      - Writing code
      - Studying (Yes, really!)
      - Socialising
```
Line 55 is yet another variable declaration.  It's followed by a `datatype` 
modifier in line **56**.  This time, the data type is `checkboxes`.  The 
[`checkboxes` datatype](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#fields%20checkboxes)
displays a list wich checkboxes.  A user can tick multiple boxes and which values
have been ticked (and not ticked) are stored in `MJFhobbies` (in this case).

We have seen the `choices` line that is line **57** a few times before, for 
displaying a [drop-down menu](./00-42#lines-35-to-38) and also for the
[radio buttons](./00-60#lines-37-to-41) we discussed above.  As our data type
is `checkboxes`, the `choices` to be displayed will be the items that make up
the checkbox list.  

And, finally, we can see these items in lines **58 to 63**.

:::note
We're getting a little ahead of ourselves here.  You'll notice that this is
the first time you'll have come across a variable (`MJFhobbies`) that will
have stored in it *multiple* data. In this case we are storing a
the list of choices along 
with information about whether they have been selected or not.  

It *is* possible to store more than one thing in a variable. We will cover 
how and why we do this in Chapter 3.

:::

### Line 13
Yes, we're skipping back up to the top of our code.
```yaml
  Your annual income    | ${ currency(MJFannualincome) }
```
This line displays a row of data in the [table](./00-42#displaying-output-in-a-table)
which starts in line 8.  The first column has text (`Your annual income`) and the
second column contains some Mako (`${ ... }`).  The interesting part of line 
13 is this `currency` and parentheses that surround our `MJFannualincome`
variable.  This is a <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='function' />.
It's called, unsurprisingly, the 'currency function', or the
'currency() function'. The currency function takes a number (ie: an 
`integer` datatype or a `currency` datatype) and displays that number as
a currency, ie: with a `$` sign and the number printed to two decimal places.

:::tip
Try removing the `currency(` and the `)` that surround `MJFannualincome`
in line 13 and run the code.  See what happens.
:::

:::info
By placing parentheses (`()`) after the word 
'currency' we're differentiating the function from the regular word but 
also from the datatype.  It is very common practice in IT to append function
names with `()`.
:::

:::info What's a Function?
For the purpose of this textbook we will consider functions to be bits of
code that we can use to manipulate our variables.  For example, we can use
functions to [display a number as a currency](https://docassemble.org/docs/functions.html#currency),
to [format dates](https://docassemble.org/docs/functions.html#format_date) and
many other things.  Docassemble has an
[extensive library](https://docassemble.org/docs/functions.html) of functions
that we can use to manipluate our data.
:::

### Line 14
```yaml
  Your favourite hobbies| ${ MJFhobbies.true_values() }
```
Again, we have something we haven't seen before in our Mako.  In this case
we have `.true_values()` appended to `MJFhobbies`.  
This is called a <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='method' />.  It's a bit
like a functionn, in that it helps us manipulate variable, but a method is
attached to a variable.  In this case, the `true_values()` method will display
the values in our checkbox list that have been selected as a nice
comma-separated list.
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_2/vitalstatistics-10.png' />

:::info
The difference between functions and methods and their syntax is something
that is beyond the scope of this textbook.  All you need to know is that 
functions look like this:
```
function(variable)
```
and methods look like this:
```
variable.method()
```
:::

## A Note About The Question Blocks
:::note
Up to now we have looked at code examples with only one or two question
blocks in them.  Our example above has five question blocks.  The first
is a mandatory block and the other four are regular question blocks.

Have a look through our [previous discussion](../00-20#execution-order) about
the order in which Docassemble executes code and try to apply that logic to
this Vital Statistics code.
:::

## A Bug in the Code
As alluded to [earlier](./00-60#line-13) there's a bug in this code.

The code runs fine (I hope you've tried it!) but if you select 'No' to
the 'Are you employed' question and
press <Components.DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_save_prop} button_text='Continue' />
nothing happens.  Why is this?

Docassemble gives us some debugging tools to help. For starters, Docassemble
provides a debugging tool in the Navbar.  It looks like this: `</>`:
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_2/vitalstatistics-11.png' />

Click on this link and a whole wealth of information is displayed.  First of all,
Docassemble displays the source code for the current question:
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_2/vitalstatistics-12.png' />

Underneath this, Docassemble tells why the current question is being asked.  In
our case we can see that Docassemble is actually trying to execute the mandatory
block:
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_2/vitalstatistics-13.png' />

Even more helpful than this, the last line tells us what Docassemble is looking for:
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_2/vitalstatistics-14.png' />

Well, that's very helpful indeed!  Docassemble is telling us this:
1. it wants to display the details in our mandatory question block;
1. but in order to do so it needs a value to be put into `MJFannualincome`
1. so it tries to ask the employment question (as that question contains code 
to ask for `MJFannualincome`)

Our problem is that, because we said we're unemployed, no value is ever put into
`MJFannualincome` as it's not displayed.
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_2/vitalstatistics-15.png' />

Because we don't display the `MJFannualincome` question, we can't put a value into
`MJFannualincome`.  But the mandatory question block *requires* a value for
`MJFannualincome` so that it can display the table row in line 13 of our code, 
otherwise it won't display. 

The end result is us getting stuck at the employment screen. That's a problem.

### Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug we want to tell Docassemble to print out the table row in line 13
*only if* we've collected a value for `MJFannualincome`.

How do we do this?

Well, once again, we're getting a bit ahead of ourselves.  We are going to use
an 'if statement'.
:::tip TODO
Link 'if statement' to appropriate part of ch 3 once it appears
:::
An if statement allows us to code some 'if-this-then-that' logic into our application.
In our case we want to code:
> If there is no value in `MJFannualincome` then don't display line 13.

We'll flip that statement around because it's easier to code a positive than 
a negative.  So, we want to code:
> If there *is* a value in `MJFannualincome` then display line 13

(otherwise, we won't display it).

How can we work out if `MJFannualincome` has a value?  Well, one way is to 
check `MJFisemployed`.  If `MJFisemployed` is `Yes` then `MJFannualincome` will
have a value put in it.

:::info
The very act of displaying the question on a screen causes Docassemble to assign
a value to a variable. In our code, once the user selects 'Yes', then the 
question for `MJFannualincome` is displayed and the user is required to put 
a value into it.

We could have told Docassemble not to make 
`MJFannualincome` [a required field](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#required).
Had we done so, and then had a user not entered a value into `MJFannualincome`
then Docassemble would have put a value, 0 in this case (as `MJFannualincome` is
a `currency` data type), into `MJFannualincome`.

So, in order to ensure a variable has a value, at a minimum it must be dispalayed
on a screen.
:::

So, let's rephrase what we want to take this into account:
> If the value of `MJFisemployed` is `Yes` then display line 13.

We can express that code as follows:
```python
  % if MJFisemployed == 'Yes':
  Your annual income    | ${ currency(MJFannualincome) }
  % endif 
```

We have wrapped an 'if statement' around our line 13.  The first line (`% if ...`)
is the 'If the value of `MJFisemployed` is `Yes`' part of our statement above.

The line that follows is our original line 13.  If the value of `MJFisemployed`
is `Yes` then this line will be included in our code and that row of the table
will be displayed.

The next line (`% endif`) tells Docassemble we're at the end of our 'if statement'
and to resume processing as normal.

This code will:
* display our line 13 if `MJFisemployed` is set to `Yes`; and
* skip over our line 13 otherwise

That will solve our bug.

As stated, we deal with if statements in more detail in [Chapter 3](../chapter_3),
so don't worry too much if you don't understand this now.

### The Fixed Code
For completeness, here is an amended version of our Vital Statistics code 
that fixes the bug by incorporating the if statement above.  Try and run it
in your Playground and answer No to the employment question.

## A Recap
In Chapter 2 we have progressed from making a basic 'hello world' 
program to something quite more sophisticated.  We can ask questions,
present choices, format text and make Word and PDF documents available to our
user.  We are very much at the point where we can write 'real' applications.

It's worth reflecting on where we are now and also remembering a few key points:
* question blocks are not just for asking questions.  They can be used to 
display output (and we will be doing that a lot);
* Docassemble looks for mandatory blocks to execute from the top down and it
calls other blocks only if it needs them.
* [spacing, indenting, dashes](./00-10#indents-spacing-and-dashes-oh-my) are
*really* important.  Docassemble gets grumpy if spacing and indentation is
not what it should be;
* [brackets and braces](./00-20#mako) are also very important.  Remember all
the different types and what they're used for;
* we use Markdown to format text in our app (but not in our attachments);
* the Example Blocks in your Playground are *really really* useful!
* <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='mako' upper /> is not a shark; and
* <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='jinja' upper /> is not a spice!

Let's move on to [Chapter 3](../chapter_3) where we start to discuss how to control
the logic flow of our applications.
