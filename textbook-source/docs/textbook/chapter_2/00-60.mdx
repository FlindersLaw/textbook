title: Vital Statistics - A More Sophisticated Example
---
import * as Constants from '@site/src/constants'
import * as Components from '@site/src/components'

We've learnt lots of things over this chapter.  We can write code!  We can also:
*  ask questions;
* use <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='markdown' upper /> to format and 
display text;
* we know the difference between <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='mandatoryblock' plural />
and regular <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='questionblock' plural />;
* We can use tables to set out our final screens;
* We can present choices in a drop-down; and
* We can create custom word and PDF documents based on the answers we receive.

The code below is for an app called 'Vital Statistics'.  It presents some important
information about the user and in the process makes more use of what we have
learnt so far.  The code uses a lot of what we have learnt over the course of
this chapter and also introduces a few new concepts.  Let's work through it.

## Lines 30 to 33
We're starting at line 30 because this is where some of the new concepts are.
If you read through lines 1 to 29 you'll see a mandatory question block that
looks very similar to our [Hello World 5](./00-50) example.  The table has
different information (and we'll come back to that) but otherwise this code
is very similar to `hello_world5.yml`.

Let's look at lines 30 to 33
```yaml
question: How old are you?
fields:
  - no label: MJFage
    datatype: integer
```
First, we have [seen `no label` before](./00-30#the-second-question-block).
What we haven't seen however is line 30:
```yaml
    dataype: integer
```
Firstly, we can see that the word `datatype` is aligned with `no label`.  You'll
recall that line 29 has the dash-label-variable format that we have seen 
[before](./00-42#presenting-choices-in-a-question) and which 'declares' a
variable.  That is, line 29 is telling Docassemble how to ask a question so
we can get a value for a variable, `MJFage` in this case.

Line 30, because of the alignment and the lack of a dash, is tied to line 29.
Line 30 is giving us more information about variable declared at line 29.
We say that line 30 *describes*, or *modifies*,
the variable declaration at line 29.

Line 30 is sets the 'data type' of the variable `MJFage` to be an integer.

:::info What is a Data Type?
As we said [early on](./00-20#variables), `MJFage` is a variable and we 
can 'put stuff in' a variable.  By stuff we mean data.  **We store data
in a variable**.

We can have different types of data.  Up until now we have been storing text,
or <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='string' plural /> in our variables.
Strings are the default data type.  There are also other data types, as we'll
see as we work our way through this textbook.

Line 30 sets the data type to be an **integer**.
An [**integer** data type](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#numbers)
allows us to store whole numbers only (ie: 1, 2,
3, 4 etc).  We can't store a string in an integer data type.  If we do we'll
get an error:
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_2/vitalstatistics-1.png' />

Using a data type can be useful to control, or *validate* the input a user
enters.  In our case, we are forcing the user to enter a number and not words
into this text box.  This could come in handy later if we, say, wanted to 
check the number was bigger or smaller than another number.  For example, we
might want to check the age to make sure a user is over 18 years old and
therefore an adult.

## Lines 37 to 41
```yaml
  - Are you employed?: MJFisemployed
    datatype: radio
    choices:
      - Yes
      - No
```
Here we again see a variable declaration at line 37, with a `datatype` modifier
at line 38.  This time, the data type is `radio`.
A [radio data type](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#radio) presents
a list of choices to the user and requires them to select only one choice.
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_2/vitalstatistics-1.png' />

This means only the values `Yes` or `No` can be placed into `MJFisemployed`.

:::note
`Yes` and `No` are <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='string' /> values.
As we'll see further in this text book, when we want to ask a 'yes or no' 
question, a better way to do so is to use a <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='boolean' />
data type.

## Lines 42 and 47 to 49
```yaml
  - What is your {income}?: MJFannualincome
...
terms:
  income: |
    Your income should be your gross (ie: before tax) income
```
The braces (`{}`) surrounding the word `income` tell Docassemble to look for 
a [term](https://docassemble.org/docs/modifiers.html#terms).  Terms are a
great way to
