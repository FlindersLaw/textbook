title: Hello World 3

import * as Constants from '@site/src/constants'
import * as Components from '@site/src/components'

Time to start getting a little more sophisticated.  We're going to modify our
[Hello World](./00-20) program and:

* add some buttons on the final screen;
* use a bit more Markdown; and
* re-format our question so it's a little easier to read.

Let's get started!

## Create a new file
Just like [before](./00-20/create-a-new-file) we should copy our code from
the `hello_world2.yml` we created into a new file called `hello_world3.yml`.

Once you've copied the file across, modify it and make it look like this:
```yaml title='hello_world3.yml' showLineNumbers
# Hello world
---
# My first Docassemble program
mandatory: True
question: Hello World!
subquestion: |
  #### Welcome to my first ever Docassemble interview

  Today I learnt:

  - what a mandatory code block is;
  - how to use a variable; and
  - a *little bit* of Markdown

  I, **${ MJFname }**, am pretty happy with myself!
buttons:
  - I'm done: exit
    url: https://flinders.edu.au
  - Do it again: restart
---
question: Name
subquestion: |
  Please enter your full name, including your middle name if you have one
fields:
  - no label: MJFname
---
```
:::caution
Once again, make sure all your [spaces, indents, dashes (hyphens)](./00-10/#indents-spacing-and-dashes-oh-my)
and [brackets and braces](./00-20/#mako) are properly formatted and aligned.
:::

## Review the Code
OK, now let's review the changes we've made.

### Markdown
We touched on Markdown [before](./00-20/#markdown).  Lines 7 to 15 demonstrate
a other things we can do with Markdown.

#### Line 7
Line 7 is a **heading**.  The hash characters (`#`) that precede the text indicate
what level heading it is.  In our case we have a level 4 heading as we have 
four hashes.  A level 1 heading would have had one hash, a level 2 two hashes
and so-on.

### Lists
#### Lines 9 to 13
These lines lay out a bullet list.  

Lines 9 and 10 introduce the list:
```yaml
  Today I learnt:

```
There must be a blank line between the text that precedes a list (line 9) and
the list items themselves (lines 11 to 13). 
```yaml
  - what a mandatory code block is;
  - how to use a variable; and
  - a *little bit* of Markdown
```
Making a bullet list is simple.  Start each line off with a dash (`-`), as
we have here or a star (`*`).  Both work the same way.

You can make a numbered list by replacing the dashes with numbers (eg: `1.`).
So, we could have displayed our list as a numbered list if we'd done this:
```yaml
  1. what a mandatory code block is;
  2. how to use a variable; and
  3. a *little bit* of Markdown
```
or even this:
```yaml
  1. what a mandatory code block is;
  1. how to use a variable; and
  1. a *little bit* of Markdown
```
Docassemble will see the number and will number the list consecutively for us.

#### Terminating the list
A bullet or numbered list has to be terminated by a blank line.  If you don't
terminate a list with a blank line the line that follows the list will simply
run into the last item of the list, like this:
<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_2/hello_world3-1.png' />

### Buttons
Lines 16 to 19 are how we set up buttons on our final screen.  Let's work 
this line by line.

#### Line 16
```yaml
buttons:
```
Tells Docassemble that what's coming next is going to be one or more buttons.
Note that line 16 starts at the left margin of the code and the buttons that
follow are all indented.

#### Line 17
```yaml
  - I'm done: exit
```
Line 17 consists of three parts:
1. A dash (`-`).  This tells Docassemble that line 17 is the first item in
a list of buttons.
1. Some text between the dash and a colon (`:`).  This is the text that will 
be displayed on the button; and
1. a command after the colon.  This tells the button what to do.

So, line 17 tells docassemble to display a button containing the text
'I'm done', and when the button is pressed, the app should exit.

The button should look like this: <Components.DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_delete_prop} button_text="I'm done" />

#### Line 18
```yaml
    url: https://flinders.edu.au
```
Note how line 18 is indented so that `url:` is left-aligned with `I'm done` and,
importantly, not with the dash on line 17.  This tells Docasemble that line 18
provides more information to whatever exists above it.  In this case, line 18
is relates to the button on line 17 and is telling that button that, when 
it exits, it should display the Flinders University
website (`https://flinders.edu.au`).

#### Line 19
```yaml
  - Do it again: restart
```
We're experts at buttons now, so we know that:
1. this is a new button (because of the dash at the front);
1. the text of the button will be 'Do it again'; and
1. when pressed, the button will execute the `restart` command.  `restart`
will clear out all the program data and start the program again.

:::note The Free Continue Button
You'll notice that the second
question block, the one that asks for the value for `MJFname` displays
a <Components.DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_save_prop} button_text="Continue" />
button, but we never asked it to.  There is no `buttons:` tag in the 
second question block.  Why does it display a Continue button even though
we haven't asked for one?

When Docasemble sees that a question block contains `fields:` it assumes that
the user must continue past that screen to the rest of the program.  So, 
Docassemble adds the Continue button automatically for us.
:::

### The Second Question Block
This second question block looks a bit different to our `hello_world2` example.
Let's look into it.

First we have a new `subquestion` tag on line 22.
We've [seen this before](./00-10#lines-4-and-5).
Use use `subquestion` tags to put more detailed information in our screen.

Line 25 is new though, or at least this `no label` is.  In `hello_world2`
we had the question label (`What is your name?`) here.  By replacing this 
label with `no label` we tell Docassemble not to display a label in front
of the question field.  This is useful in this example as the contents of
the `subquestion` already contain instructions as to what to put in the field.
Our label would have been redundant, so we use `no label` to remove it.

:::note Let's talk about fields (baby)
Using `no label` is only one of many ways to customise a field.  Docassemble
comes with many different [field options](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#fields%20options)  Here are some
other examples:
* Make a field [optional](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#required)
* Embed [helfpul hints](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#hint)
in a field or [in its label](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#help)
* [Show](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#show%20if) and
[hide](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#hide%20if) fields dynamically

The [Setting Variables](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html) part of the
[Docassemble Manual](https://docassemble.org/docs.html) is your friend.
