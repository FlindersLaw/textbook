Up to now, our hello world programs have asked us to type in our full name.
However, what we *really* want is to break our name out into 
first name and last name.  What we also want to do is collect
our 'saultation', that is, whether we're addressed as 'Mr', 'Ms', 'Dr' etc.

Let's see how we do this

## Our Code
This code is also available in `C1_04_hello_world.yml` in the teaching code
repository

# My first Docassemble program
mandatory: True
question: Hello World!
subquestion: |
  ### Welcome to Docassemble!

  Dear ${ MJFsalutation + ' ' + MJFlastname },

  This is a quick introduction to Markdown.

  Two lines for a line break
  because a single line doesn't break at all.

  - Here's a list
  - with some items
  - in it

  **Here's some bold text** and *text in italics*.

  Column1|Column2
  -------|-------
  Salutation|${ MJFsalutation }
  First Name|${ MJFfirstname }
  Last Name|${ MJFlastname }
buttons:
  - I'm done: exit
    url: https://flinders.edu.au
  - Do it again: restart
---
question: Name
fields:
  - Salutation: MJFsalutation
    choices:
      - Dr
      - Mr
      - Mrs
      - Ms
  - First Name: MJFfirstname
  - Last Name: MJFlastname
---
```

## The Second Question Block
One thing that stands out in the second question block is that we're not asking
one question.  Now we're asking three.  You can see each of lines 33, 39 and 40
look similar to the single question we asked in our previous iterations of
`hello world`, that is, a dash, a label and a variable.

So, first thing to take away from this example is that we can ask more than
one question in a question block.  Here we're asking three.

The second and third questions, on lines 39 and 40 respectively are in a
format we've seen already and they do what we would expect: provide a label
and text field to ask for our first and last names respectively.

<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_2/hello_world4-1.png' />

That first question field though, the one that collects the value of
`MJFsalutation`, that looks more interesting.  Let's look at that.

### Presenting Choices in a Question
Again, line 33 looks familiar to us: dash, label, variable.  What follows is 
new though.  Let's go through this:

#### Line 34
```
    choices:
```
Line 34 gives Docassemble more information about the question on line 33.
We can tell this as the word `choices` is aligned under `Salutation`.

:::info
We've seen this alignment, or 'identation' already when we set up
a [link for the exit button](./00-30#line-18) in our `hello_world3.yml`.

Docasemble uses indentation to work out whether the next line relates to 
the line above it (as line 34 relates to line 33) or describes a new element
(as lines 33, 39 and 40 do).
:::

#### Lines 35 to 38
```
    choices:
      - Dr
      - Mr
      - Mrs
      - Ms
```
When Docassemble sees a `choices` keyword under a field it will present the
user with a list of choices to select from.  This list is supplied in lines
35 to 38.  Each dash indicates a new list item.   The user will be presented
with this list and will be invited to select one.

<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_2/hello_world4-2.png' />

By default, a question field with choices that appears with other fields in 
a question block will be presented as a drop-down menut, as ours is.  It's also
possible to display choices as radio buttons or even as icons.  We will
cover these alternatives further in this textbook.

:::tip TODO
And here would be a good place to introduce objects, at least for 
`Individual`s.  Don't think we should do this in this iteration of the 
textbook as it would necessitate also updating the teaching code repo but
raise it as an issue in GitHub for a subsequent revision.
:::

## The Mandatory Block
Our mandatory question block at lines 3 to 30 has a bit that's familiar
and introduces some new content as well.

Let's cover the familiar first

### More Markdown
Lines 6, 7 and 9 to 19 are simply Markdown that we  already know and love.
We have already covered lists, bolding and itallicising text.  Refer to the
Example Block in your Playground for more examples of these and how they work.

<details>
<summary>How Markdown recognises new paragraphs</summary>
Note that lines 12 and 13 contain two lines of text.  However, when the 
program runs, these two lines will be displayed as a single line of text.  

<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_2/hello_world4-3.png' />

In order to create a new paragraph in Markdown you must have a blank line
between text.
</details>

#### Line 8
```
  Dear ${ MJFsalutation + ' ' + MJFlastname},
```
We  have seen Mako to display a variable [before](./00-20) but this is more
complex.  Let's break this Mako down.

This Mako is displaying three elements all joined together.  The plus (`+`) 
sign is a joining operator in <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='python' />,
that is, we use it to join variables together and display them as a single
line, or <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='string' /> of text. 

:::info
When we evaluate Mako we are actually evaluating very
small bits of <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='python' /> code.
:::

So, `MJFsalutation + ' ' + MJFlastname` takes the value of `MJFsalutation`,
joins it to a single whitespace (`' '`) and then joins that to `MJFlastname`.

If, for example, `MJFsalutation` was 'Mr' and `MJFlastname` was set to 'Smith'
then `MJFsalutation + ' ' + MJFlastname` would display `Mr Smith`.

:::info
Python isn't smart enough to separate words, which is why we need to join
a space character between `MJFsalutation` and `MJFlastname`.  If all we did
was to evaluate `MJFsalutation + MJFlastname` (which makes more sense to 
us humans!) we would end up with `MrSmith` and not `Mr Smith`.
:::

Finally, at the end of that Mako, and sitting outside the right curly brace
(`}`) is a comma (`,`).  Because that sits outside the Mako braces it is
displayed as a comma, just like 'Dear' at the beginning of the line is also
displayed literally.

### Displaying Output in a Table
```markdown 
  Column1|Column2
  -------|-------
  Salutation|${ MJFsalutation }
  First Name|${ MJFfirstname }
  Last Name|${ MJFlastname }
```
Markdown allows you to display information in a table.  Once again, the 
Example Block in your Playground is your friend.

<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_2/hello_world4-5.png' />

Some rules worth noting about Markdown Tables:
* There must be a blank line before the table commands.  Otherwise, Markdown
will treat your table as regular text and display something ugly
* The first line (`Column1|Column2`) sets out the number of columns in 
your table and also the column header names.  In this example we're calling
our coulumns 'Column 1' and 'Column 2'. Each column is separated by a vertical
bar (`|`) or 'pipe'
:::note
The veritcal bar character (`|`) is called a pipe in coding-land
:::
* The second line separates the columns from the data.  The line consists of
only dashes (`-`) and pipes (`|`).The number of
pipes in the second line should match the number of pipes in the first line.
* The following three lines are the data for the table row.  Each line can be
broken down into three parts:
  * data for the first column
  * a pipe (`|`)
  * data for the second column

Markdown tables are a simple (if hard to read) way of displaying output in
a more readable form.

:::note
Line 22 has a sufficient number of dashes so that the pipe lines up with
the pipe in line 21.  This is not necessary.  This syntax is also valid:
```
  Column1|Column2
  ---|---
It doesn't look as neat though.
