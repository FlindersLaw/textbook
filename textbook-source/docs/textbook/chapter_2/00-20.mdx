Let's take the [Hello World](./00-10) program you just wrote and add some more features,
namely:

* we'll get Docassemble to ask for the user's name before displaying the final screen; and
* we'll get Docassemble to display the user's name in **bold text**.

## Create a new file
First thing is to create a new file and copy the code over.

1. Before you create the new file, copy the existing code in the text editor.
We'll paste it into the new file shortly.
1. Click on the ![Add](/img/textbook/add_button.png) button and create a new file called `hello_world2.yml`.
:::tip
Refer to how we did this [previously](./00-10/#your-first-program).
:::
1. Paste the code you copied from `hello_world.yml` into this new file and 
press <Highlight color={da_declared_variable}>Save</Highlight>.
1. Then press <Highlight color={da_unused_variable}>Save and Run</Highlight> 
to make sure the program still runs OK.
