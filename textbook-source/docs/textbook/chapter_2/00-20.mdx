title: Hello World 2

Our existing [Hello World](./00-10) program, while truly a software engineering masterpiece,
is somewhat impersonal.  What we *really* want it to do is to display the user's name and,
for good measure, display their **name in bold**.

Let's get to making that happen.

## Create a new file
First thing is to create a new file and copy the code over.

1. Before you create the new file, copy the existing code in the text editor.
We'll paste it into the new file shortly.
1. Click on the <Components.DisplayImage 
    borderStyle={Constants.DI_inline_shadow}
    altText='Add' 
    imageURL='/img/textbook/add_button.png' />
button and create a new file called `hello_world2.yml`.
:::tip
Refer to how we did this [previously](./00-10/#your-first-program).
:::
1. Paste the code you copied from `hello_world.yml` into this new file and 
press <Components.DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_save_prop} />.
1. Then press <Components.DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_save_and_run_prop} />
to make sure the program still runs OK.

## Make some changes
First we need to  <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='dunno' />
