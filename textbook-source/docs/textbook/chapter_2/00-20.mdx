title: Hello World 2

import * as Constants from '@site/src/constants'
import {Highlight} from '@site/src/components/Highlight'
import {DisplayDAButtons} from '@site/src/components/DisplayDAButtons'
import {DisplayImage} from '@site/src/components/DisplayImage'

Let's take the [Hello World](./00-10) program you just wrote and add some more features,
namely:

* we'll get Docassemble to ask for the user's name before displaying the final screen; and
* we'll get Docassemble to display the user's name in **bold text**.

## Create a new file
First thing is to create a new file and copy the code over.

1. Before you create the new file, copy the existing code in the text editor.
We'll paste it into the new file shortly.
1. Click on the <DisplayImage 
    borderStyle={Constants.DI_inline_shadow}
    altText='Add' 
    imageURL='/img/textbook/add_button.png' />
button and create a new file called `hello_world2.yml`.
:::tip
Refer to how we did this [previously](./00-10/#your-first-program).
:::
:::tip TODO
Use `DisplayImage()` to display the Add button.  Need to change
`display: block` and the `margin` and the borders as well.  Need 
a clean inline style
:::
1. Paste the code you copied from `hello_world.yml` into this new file and 
press <DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_save_prop} />.
1. Then press <DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_save_and_run_prop} />
to make sure the program still runs OK.
