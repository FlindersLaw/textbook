It is a tradition in coding, since this author was a boy, that the first program a programmer should write is
one that simply announces its presence to the world by way of simply displaying the text 'Hello World!'.
Who are we to shirk tradition?

## Your first program
As tradition dictates, let's make a 'Hello World' program:

1. Go to your [Playground](/docs/textbook/chapter_1/00-30#the-playground)
1. Click on the 'Add' button
1. Call your program `hello_world.yml`
  > ![image](/img/textbook/chapter_2/hello_world1.png)
1. Enter the code displayed in the code snippet below into the [text editor](/docs/textbook/chapter_1/00-30#3-text-editor)
1. Press Save

```docassemble title="hello_world.yml" showLineNumbers
---
# Our first program!
mandatory: True
question: Hello World!
subquestion: |
  Hello,

  Welcome to Docassemble!
---
```
<details>
    <summary>About code snippets</summary>
We use code snippets extensively in this textbook to display code.  A code snippet 
comes with some useful features:

1. There are line numbers down the left side.  We will use these line numbers to explain where we are in the code.  Line numbers are also useful as a check to ensure you've typed code
into the text editor correctly.  Just check the line numbers match up.
1. If you hover your mouse over the top right of the code block a 'Copy' button will appear.  Use this to copy code in the code block into the text editor (or anywhere else for that matter)

</details>
<p></p>
Let's work through that code line by line.

### Lines 1 and 9
These are **block delimiters**.

In Docassemble, we write our code in **blocks**.  We might use blocks to ask questions, display screens,
run code to make decisions and so-on. Every block of code we write must start and end with three dash characters (`---`).
If we have multiple blocks together then we separate each block with `---`, for example:
```docassemble
---
question: This is a question block
subquestion: |
  With a short description in here
---
question: This is another question block
subquestion: |
  Another short description in here.
  Note how each block is separated by `---` characters.
---
```

### Line 2
This is a **comment line**.  Comment lines start with a `#` character.  When Docassemble
sees the `#` it skips over the line and doesn't process it.  We use comment lines to describe
what code does.  It makes our code easier to read.

### Line 3
This is a **mandatory** tag. Adding a mandatory tag and setting it to `True` tells Docassemble that it
must execute this block.  Docassemble does not always execute each block.  We'll to more about that
later in this textbook.  For now, just remember that to force a block to run you must set it as
`mandatory: True`.

:::info
We usually refer to a block with `mandatory: True` in it as a **mandatory block**
:::

### Lines 4 and 5
Line 4 contains a **question** tag, and line 5 contains a **subquestion** tag.

We use `question` and `subquestion` tags for two purposes:
1. asking questions; and
1. displaying information.

In that sense, calling the tag 'question' is a little misleading as `question` tags
are not limited only to asking questions.

Usually we'll use the `question` tag for the title or heading of the question.  We'll then
put a more detailed explanation in the `subquestion`.  See  lines 6 to 8 for an example.

:::note A note about `question` and `subquestion` tags.
We usually use `question` to display the title or heading of a question.  Therefore, we usually
format the tag as `question: Title goes here`.

For a `subquestion` we will usually need to display content across many lines (such as lines 6 - 8) of
our `hello_world.yml`).  To display multi-line content we need to put a `: |` (ie: a colon, a space and then
a vertical bar) after the tag.  We can then display our content across multiple lines.

We can use `: |` in any tag (we'll get to other tags later) whenever we want to display
the content of that tag across many lines
:::

:::info 
When we have a block with a `question` tag in it we call that block a **question block**.  If
our block is a question block with `mandatory: True` set, then we call that block a 
**mandatory question block**.
:::

### Lines 6 to 8
These lines are the content of the `subquestion` tag.  Note how the content is indented
two spaces in from the tag itself.  Docassemble will assume that any indented text forms
part of the text to be displayed. 

## Indents, spacing and dashes, Oh my!
:::caution
Docassemble's syntax is heavily dependent on *where* code appears in a file. So...

* All tags and block separators must start at the left margin.
* All content following a `: |` *must* be indented by **two spaces**.  Docassemble
will not accept, one or three or five.  It must be two spaces.
* All tags are case sensitive.  `Question:` is not the same as `question:`.  If you input
`Question:` Docassemble will generate a syntax error.  Case is important in Docassemble.
* There *must* be a space between a `:` and a `|`.  That is, `subquestion: |` is fine.  But
`subquestion:|` (no space), `subquestion:  |` (two spaces) and `Subquestion: |`
(two spaces but a capital 'S') will all generate syntax errors.

Docasemble is very fussy with syntax.  If you get errors when writing your code, you 
should check syntax first.  Make sure your spaces, cases and (eventually) dashes are
all correct.

:::tip
Pressing the Tab key in the text editor automatically indents your text for you
by two spaces.
:::

:::tip TODO
We should link all the different tags to the Docassemble manual.

We also might need to link the bold terms into a glossary.

## Run the program
Type (or copy and paste) the `hello_world.yml` code snippet above into your text editor.
It should look like this:

![Code in text editor](/img/textbook/chapter_2/hello_world2.png)

:::note
The line numbers in the text editor match up with the line numers in the
code snippet
:::

Press <Highlight color={da_declared_variable}>Save</Highlight> and then 
press <Highlight color={da_unused_variable}>Save and Run</Highlight>. Your program
will run and should display this output:

![Hello World output](/img/textbook/chapter_2/hello_world3.png)

Congratulations! You have run your first Docassemble program!

:::tip TODO
Ex1a should get inserted here.
