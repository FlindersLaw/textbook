This chapter is a collection of case studies and example coding projects that demonstrate certain
advanced coding concepts.  Each case study is organised in its own subsection with a description of 
the concepts covered.

Each case study starts with a skeleton set of code and builds on it.  You are encouraged to copy
the skeleton code into your Playground and work along with each case study.  

Each case study also contains a copy of the final source code.  You are encouraged to copy this code
into your Playground and experiment with it.

New case studies will be added regularly to this chapter.  Be sure to
check back on this chapter regularly
