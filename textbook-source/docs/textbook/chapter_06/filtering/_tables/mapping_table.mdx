            It's easier for us to split out the age limit into minimum and
            maximum age variables and test that the user's age falls inside
            the min and max ages. We will need additional code to cope with
            the 'and over' requirements in some of the data.  We will deal
            with this when we code the age test.

            ie: the data type will be a list containing one item.
