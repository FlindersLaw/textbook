This part of our app is the most logically complex part.  It's going to take us some
time to wade through it.  So, grab a coffee, grab some food, grab your therapist
and let's get going!

## The parent loop
As we said in our [Introduction](00-20) the plan is to store all our decision-making code
in `process_data.yml`.  Also, in our [design](00-10#evaluate-against-service-criteria) we
worked out pretty quickly that all our decision-making is going to be based around a 
loop that iterates over `MJFservices`.  So, we may as well start with that:
```yml title="process_data.yml" showLineNumbers
---
code: |
  for a_service in MJFservices:
    # Loop body
    # Lots of work will get done here!
---
```

## The evaluation criteria
In our [design](00-10#loop-body) we also worked out that the loop body consisted of these components:
1. determine if `MJFage` fits in the age criteria;
1. determine if `MJFgender` fits in the gender criteria;
1. determine if `MJFlocation` fits in the location criteria;
1. determine if `MJFfamily` fits in the family criteria;
1. use a logical 'and' to ensure all these criteria are met;
1. add the service to a display list if the criteria are met.

Let's build out our loop body a bit more:
```yml title="process_data.yml" showLineNumbers
---
code: |
  for a_service in MJFservices:

    # Set MJFage_ok

    # Set MJFgender_ok

    # Set MJFlocation_ok

    # Set MJFfamily_ok

    # Test criteria and add to relevant services list
---
```
### `MJFage_ok`
We have [an idea](00-10#the-age-question) of how to code `MJFage_ok`.  We need to replace
the numbers in our design with the actual `min_age` and `max_age` from the service in 
`a_service`.  Our `MJFage_ok` test should look like this:
```python
MJFage_ok = a_service['min_age'] <= MJFage <= a_service['max_age']
```

### `MJFgender_ok` and `MJFfamily_ok`
In our design we worked out that both the [gender](00-10#the-gender-question)
and [family](00-10#the-family-question)  evalutaions were list membership tests.  The code
for both is in our design and is:
```python
MJFgender_ok = MJFgender in a_service['gender']
```
and
```python
MJFfamily_ok = MJFfamily in a_service['family']
```

### `MJFlocation_ok`
We concluded that [testing for locations](00-10#the-location-question) was a little more complex
than the other questions, this being because a user can select more than one location.  It follows
then that we must test each location the user selected against the location list in `a_service`
and, if any location matches, then set `MJFlocation_ok` to true.

We can use iteration to solve the multiple location issue.  However, we also have a second issue.
How do we manage a situation where one location matches but the second does not?  How can we
ensure that `MJFlocation_ok` remains `True` in this context?

We manage this `MJFlocation_ok` issue by setting it to `False` *before* we start the loop. As
we iterate over the locations, we change `MJFlocation_ok` to `True` if we find a  match
but if a location doesn't match we do nothing. What we're doing is starting out with
the assumption that we won't get any matches (ie: `MJFlocation_ok == False`) and,
if we find at least one match we set `MJFlocation_ok` to `True`.  It only 
takes one match to permanently set `MJFlocation_ok` to `True`.

Let's see this in code:
```python showLineNumbers
MJFlocation_ok = False
for a_location in MJFlocation.true_values():
    if a_location in a_service['location']:
        MJFlocation_ok = True
```
Line 1 sets `MJFlocation_ok` to `False` as we just discussed.  Line 2 is the loop that iterates over
the user's selected locations.  Lines 3 and 4 are tbe body of this loop, that body being an if statement
which sets `MJFlocation_ok` to `True` if a match is found but does nothing otherwise.

### Adding code to the relevant services list
In our design we discussed how to [test the four criteria together](00-10#the-decision) and we even have
code ready to go.  What we don't have though is the code that does the adding to the relevant services
list.  For that matter, we don't have code that defines a relevant services list at all!  Maybe we need 
to start there.

In order to add code to a relevant services list we need to define a list to begin with.  Let's call
it `MJFrelevant_services`.  We're going to define our list as a [`DAList`](https://docassemble.org/docs/objects.html#DAList)
so we can make use of some of the extra features a `DAList` provides, in particular,
[groups](https://docassemble.org/docs/groups.html) and [gathering](https://docassemble.org/docs/groups.html#details).

We use an [`objects`](https://docassemble.org/docs/initial.html#objects) block to declare our list.
```yml
---
objects:
  - MJFrelevant_services: DAList.using(auto_gather=False)
---
```
We'll put this `objects` block at the top of our `process_data.yml`.  It's good practice to put blocks
that declare stuff (like object blocks) before blocks that do stuff (like code blocks and question blocks).

Now that we have a list we need to firstly initialise it:
```python
MJFrelevant_services.clear()
```
This code will have to go as the first line of our [code block](#the-parent-loop), before the parent loop.

The adding part will be done by the `append()` method.

:::info
The Docassemble [manual entry for `DAList`](https://docassemble.org/docs/initial.html#DAList) discusses
the `clear()` and `append()` methods in a bit more detail.
:::

Now we have enough to write the code for all our evaluation criteria.  Let's see what our `process_data.yml`
should look like.

## Brining it all together
```yml title="process_data.yml" showLineNumbers
---
objects:
  - MJFrelevant_services: DAList.using(auto_gather=False)
---
code: |
  MJFrelevant_services.clear()
  for a_service in MJFservices:

    # Set MJFage_ok
    MJFage_ok = a_service['min_age'] <= MJFage <= a_service['max_age']

    # Set MJFgender_ok
    MJFgender_ok = MJFgender in a_service['gender']

    # Set MJFlocation_ok
    MJFlocation_ok = False
    for a_location in MJFlocation.true_values():
      if a_location in a_service['location']:
        MJFlocation_ok = True

    # Set MJFfamily_ok
    MJFfamily_ok = MJFfamily in a_service['family']

    # Test criteria and add to relevant services list
    if MJFage_ok and MJFgender_ok and MJFlocation_ok and MJFfamily_ok:
      MJFrelevant_services.append(a_service)

  # How we tell Docassemble we've finished gathering relevant services
  # into MJFrelevant_services
  MJFrelevant_services.gathered = True
---
```

Before we move to testing let's discuss line 30 briefly.  As we already know, when
Docassemble encounters a variable to display in question block it looks for the block
to set a value for that variable.  A similar thing happens with `DAList`s but it is in
two phases.  When Docassemble encounters a `DAList` that needs to be displayed it does
two things:
1. it looks to define that list; and then
1. it tries to 'gather' the list.

The first step is addressed by our `objects` block.  It tells Docassemble that our
`MJFrelevant_services` list is a DAList.  Docassemble tries to satisfy the 'gathering'
part by looking for a `.gathered` property of our list.  We have set `.gathered` to
`True` as the last line of our code block.  That means that Docassemble will execute
our entire code block, thus populating `MJFrelevant_services`, and then set 
`MJFrelevant_services.gathered` to true, telling Docassemble that `MJFrelevant_services`
has been gathered.

## Testing
We can use a table block to test `MJFrelevant_services` just like we tested `MJFservices`
[previously](00-40#testing).  Let's add this table block to `tests.yml`:
```
---
table: relevant_services_test_table
rows: MJFrelevant_services
columns:
  - Name: row_item['name']
  - Website: row_item['website']
  - Age Range: |
      "{} to {}".format(row_item['min_age'], row_item['max_age'])
  - Gender: row_item['gender']
  - Locations: row_item['location']
  - Family: row_item['family']
---
```
And add this line to the end of `final_screen` in `main.yml`:
```yml
${ relevant_services_test_table}
```
:::tip
Remember to leave a blank line between `${services_test_table}` and `${relevant_services_test_table}`.
:::

:::tip
Don't forget to add `process_data.yml` to the `include` block in `main.yml`!
:::

Run the program.  We should see, first, the answers to our questions, then the table of 
`MJFservices` and finally a second table showing only the relevant services filtered
according to the answers to our questions:

<DisplayImage imageURL="/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/coding5.png" />

Our decision-making logic is now complete. It looks ugly but it's complete.
We now need to prepare the PDF and style our app to make it look a bit more pleasing to the eye.

:::note
#### On the Importance of Design
Before we move on, the authors would like to draw your attention to the relative brevity of this
part of the case study.  There was some reasonably somphisticated coding invovled yet it was 
dealt with relatively briefly without sacrificing clarity (in our opinion!).  The reason for this
was because of the effort we put into the design *before* we started any coding.  Most of the
brains work was done at the design stage and not during coding.  This is evidenced by the constant
references back to the design throughout this part of the chater.

Pelase keep this in mind.  It is often tempting  to skip past code design, much like it is
tempting to skip past essay planning, and just 'smash it out'.  However, coding does not lend
itself to smashing things out at all.  The time and effort you spend in designing your app will
be more than paid back to you at coding time.
