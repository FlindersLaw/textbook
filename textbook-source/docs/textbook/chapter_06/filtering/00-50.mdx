This part of our app is the most logically complex part.  It's going to take us some
time to wade through it.  So, grab a coffee, grab some food, grab your therapist
and let's get going!

## The parent loop
As we said in our [Introduction](00-20) the plan is to store all our decision-making code
in `process_data.yml`.  Also, in our [design](00-10#evaluate-against-service-criteria) we
worked out pretty quickly that all our decision-making is going to be based around a 
loop that iterates over `MJFservices`.  So, we may as well start with that:
```yml title="process_data.yml" showLineNumbers
---
code: |
  for a_service in MJFservices:
    # Loop body
    # Lots of work will get done here!
---
```

## The evaluation criteria
In our [design](00-10#loop-body) we also worked out that the loop body consisted of these components:
1. determine if `MJFage` fits in the age criteria;
1. determine if `MJFgender` fits in the gender criteria;
1. determine if `MJFlocation` fits in the location criteria;
1. determine if `MJFfamily` fits in the family criteria;
1. use a logical 'and' to ensure all these criteria are met;
1. add the service to a display list if the criteria are met.

Let's build out our loop body a bit more:
```yml title="process_data.yml" showLineNumbers
---
code: |
  for a_service in MJFservices:

    # Set MJFage_ok

    # Set MJFgender_ok

    # Set MJFlocation_ok

    # Set MJFfamily_ok

    # Test criteria and add to relevant services list
---
```
### `MJFage_ok`
We have [an idea](00-10#the-age-question) of how to code `MJFage_ok`.  We need to replace
the numbers in our design with the actual `min_age` and `max_age` from the service in 
`a_service`.  Our `MJFage_ok` test should look like this:
```python
MJFage_ok = a_service['min_age'] <= MJFage <= a_service['max_age']
```

### `MJFgender_ok` and `MJFfamily_ok`
In our design we worked out that both the [gender](00-10#the-gender-question)
and [family](00-10#the-family-question)  evalutaions were list membership tests.  The code
for both is in our design and is:
```python
MJFgender_ok = MJFgender in a_service['gender']
```
and
```python
MJFfamily_ok = MJFfamily in a_service['family']
```

### `MJFlocation_ok`
We concluded that [testing for locations](00-10#the-location-question) was a little more complex
than the other questions, this being because a user can select more than one location.  It follows
then that we must test each location the user selected against the location list in `a_service`
and, if any location matches, then set `MJFlocation_ok` to true.

We can use iteration to solve the multiple location issue.  However, we also have a second issue.
How do we manage a situation where one location matches but the second does not?  How can we
ensure that `MJFlocation_ok` remains `True` in this context?

We manage this `MJFlocation_ok` issue by setting it to `False` *before* we start the loop. As
we iterate over the locations, we change `MJFlocation_ok` to `True` if we find a  match
but if a location doesn't match we do nothing. What we're doing is starting out with
the assumption that we won't get any matches (ie: `MJFlocation_ok == False`) and,
if we find at least one match we set `MJFlocation_ok` to `True`.  It only 
takes one match to permanently set `MJFlocation_ok` to `True`.

Let's see this in code:
```python showLineNumbers
MJFlocation_ok = False
for a_location in MJFlocation.true_values():
    if a_location in a_service['location']:
        MJFlocation_ok = True
```
Line 1 sets `MJFlocation_ok` to `False` as we just discussed.  Line 2 is the loop that iterates over
the user's selected locations.  Lines 3 and 4 are tbe body of this loop, that body being an if statement
which sets `MJFlocation_ok` to `True` if a match is found but does nothing otherwise.

### Adding code to the relevant services list
In our design we discussed how to [test the four criteria together](00-10#the-decision) and we even have
code ready to go.  What we don't have though is the code that does the adding to the relevant services
list.  For that matter, we don't have code that defines a relevant services list at all!  Maybe we need 
to start there.

In order to add code to a relevant services list we need to define a list to begin with.  Let's call
it `MJFrelevant_services`.  We're going to define our list as a [`DAList`](https://docassemble.org/docs/objects.html#DAList)
so we can make use of some of the extra features a `DAList` provides, in particular,
[groups](https://docassemble.org/docs/groups.html) and [gathering](https://docassemble.org/docs/groups.html#details).

We use an [`objects`](https://docassemble.org/docs/initial.html#objects) block to declare our list.
