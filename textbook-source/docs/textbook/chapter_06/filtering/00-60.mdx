There are two parts to this part of our app:
1. style the app and make it look nicer than what it is; and
2. prepare a PDF attachment for downloading and emailing.

Let's deal with these in turn

## Styling the app
To summarise our styling requirements from the [design](00-10#display-the-list-of-relevant-services):
* the [ABC logo](/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/ABCInc_logo_white.png) needs to be added to the app;
* we need to use the [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) font for headings;
* we need to use the [Unna](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Unna) font for body text;
* ABC want us to make use of the colours in the logo throughout the app.

Given we're in the design phase we shoudl also add to this list:
* put descriptive text in the welcome and final screens; and
* put descriptive text in the question blocks where necessary.

Let's work through these top to bottom.

### Adding a logo
We've dealt with logos [before](/docs/textbook/chapter_07/00-20#inserting-the-logo).  We can follow the same 
process here.

First, upload the [logo](/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/ABCInc_logo_white.png) to the 'Static Files' folder
in your Playground.

Then we need to add an `objects` block to `main.yml` declaring the logo to Docassemble:
```yml
---
objects:
  - ABClogo: DAStaticFile.using(filename='ABCInc_logo_white.png')
---
```
