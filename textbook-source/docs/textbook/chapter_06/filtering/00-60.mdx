title: Coding - Display relevant services
---
import {DisplayImage} from '@site/src/components';
import {DisplayChapter} from '@site/src/components';
import {DisplayGlossaryItem} from '@site/src/components';
import * as Flowcharts from './_flowcharts';
import * as Tables from './_tables';

There are two parts to this part of our app:
1. style the app and make it look nicer than what it is; and
2. prepare a PDF attachment for downloading and emailing.

Let's deal with these in turn

## Styling the app
To summarise our styling requirements from the [design](00-10#display-the-list-of-relevant-services):
* the [ABC logo](/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/ABCInc_logo_white.png) needs to be added to the app;
* we need to use the [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) font for headings;
* we need to use the [Unna](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Unna) font for body text;
* ABC want us to make use of the colours in the logo throughout the app.

Given we're in the design phase we shoudl also add to this list:
* put descriptive text in the welcome and final screens; and
* put descriptive text in the question blocks where necessary.

Let's work through these top to bottom.

### Adding a logo
We've dealt with logos [before](/docs/textbook/chapter_07/00-20#inserting-the-logo).  We can follow the same 
process here.

First, upload the [logo](/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/ABCInc_logo_white.png) to the 'Static Files' folder
in your Playground.

Then we need to add an `objects` block to `main.yml` declaring the logo to Docassemble:
```yml
---
objects:
  - ABClogo: DAStaticFile.using(filename='ABCInc_logo_white.png')
---
```
We then need to add an extra mandatory block to set the logo:
```yml
---
mandatory: True
code: |
  set_parts(logo='<img src="' + ABClogo.url_for() + '" style="height: 50px;">')
---
```

We get something that looks like this:

<DisplayImage imageURL="/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/coding7.png" />

That doesn't look that great.  We'll take up the styling and use of colours later in this part 
of the chapter.  For now let's move to fonts.

### Changing the fonts
We'll be working with [CSS styles](/docs/textbook/chapter_07/00-20). 
We will put our styles into `ABC_styles.css` in our 'Static Files' folder.  The first thing we need to do is let
our app know about this. Let's add a `features` block to `main.yml` to let our app we're going to use our CSS file.
```yml
---
features:
  css: ABC_styles.css
---
```
:::tip hint
Add the `features` block just under the `include` block.

Docassemble doesn't care where we put our block, but it's good practice to set out preliminary blocks,
such as `include`, `objects` and `features` at the top of the code and have the 'working' blocks
(ie: our question and code blocks) following our preliminary blocks.
:::

The Una and Poppins fonts requested by ABC are a set of fonts owned by Google and made
available free of charge.  Google's [fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) are also known as
'web fonts' as they are downloadable directly from the web for use into web apps, which
is exactly what we are going to do.

We need to tell our app to download these fonts and then apply these fonts to the various
text parts of our app.

First, the download bit.  We will use the [`default screen parts`](https://docassemble.org/docs/initial.html#default%20screen%20parts)
block to download our fonts.  Again, we add this block to the top of `main.yml`.
```yml
---
default screen parts:
  post: |
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@300&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Unna&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
---
```
:::note
To get the link for a font:

1. Go to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)
1. Search for the font you're after
1. Click on the 'Show selected families' <DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/selectedfamily.png' inline /> icon
1. In the 'Use on the web' part make sure the 'link' radio button is selected.
1. From the code box copy only the line that ends in `..."stylesheet">`
1. Paste that line into the `default screen parts` as per above.
:::

Now that we have our fonts we can use them in our stylesheet.

We need to find a style element or style elements that are generic and used throughout the app.
We can then define classes with the same name as those elements to set our fonts as we wish.

:::info
Refer to [here](/docs/textbook/chapter_07/00-20#identify-the-component) for details on how to identify
styles using your browser's developer tools.
:::

It turns out that question titles are rendered in the `da-page-header` class, and
the subquestion text is displayed in a `da-subquestion` class. Let's define classes to both by
adding the below to our `ABC_styles.css`:
```css
.da-page-header {
  font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
}

.da-subquestion {
  font-family: 'Unna', sans-serif;
}
```
After making these changes our app looks like this:

<DisplayImage imageURL="/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/coding10.png" />

The heading font looks OK but the size of the body text is a bit small.  We can increase
it by adding a `font-size` to our `container` class:
```css
.da-subquestion {
    font-family: 'Unna', sans-serif;
    font-size: 18pt; 
}
```

<DisplayImage imageURL="/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/coding11.png" />

That's a bit better.  However, as we work through our app we'll see there are other
classes that we need to address.  For example, the Unna font isn't used for our 
user questions:

<DisplayImage imageURL="/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/coding12.png" />

or our radio buttons:

<DisplayImage imageURL="/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/coding13.png" />

Again, we need to use our Developer Tools to identify the classes to modify.  Where possible,
we should try to modify classes that start with `da-` as these are Docassemble classes.

A bit of poking around with the Developer tools results in:

* the text that appears before an input field is a `da-form-label`
* the text that appears in the radio buttons and checkboxes is a `dalabelauty`

We can add these styles to `ABC_styles.css`:
```css
.da-form-label {
  font-family: 'Unna', sans-serif;
  font-size: 1.2em;
}

.dalabelauty {
  font-family: 'Unna', sans-serif;
  font-size: 1.2em;
}
```
The `font-size: 1.2em` increases the font size by 20% over the default (rather small) font size.  Now
our screen looks like this:

<DisplayImage imageURL="/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/coding13a.png" />

Working through the rest of the screens it appears that there are no other styles for us to 
take account of.  Let's look at colours now.

### Working with colours
#### The Navbar
The logo with the white background on a black navbar does not look
pretty.  We'll have to change the background colour of the navbar from black
to something else.  We have dealt with changing navbar colours
[elsewhere](/docs/textbook/chapter_07/00-20#changing-the-navbar-colour). 


Let's try a white background.  Put this into `ABC_styles.css`
```css
.navbar{
    background-color: white !important;
}
```
Save and re-run the app.  This seems a bit stark.

<DisplayImage imageURL="/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/coding8.png" />

Let's add a border to the bottom of the navbar.  The border can be wide and its colour
should be the same as the dark colour in the 'A' and 'C' in the logo.

We'll add a name for the colour to our `root:` class and then add a border to our `navbar` class.
```css title="ABC_styles.css" showLineNumbers
:root {
    --ABC-darkest: rgb(10,62,92);
}

.navbar {
    background-color: white !important;
    border-bottom: 5px solid var(--ABC-darkest);
}
```

Save and re-run the app. That's an improvement:

<DisplayImage imageURL="/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/coding9.png" />

#### Identifying RGB values
</summary>
As we have [discussed elsewhere](/docs/textbook/chapter_07/00-20#how-we-describe-colours-in-code) we
need to determine RGB values for each colour we want to use. An easy way to do this
on Windows systems is to use the 'Colour picker' tool in Microsoft Paint:

<DisplayImage imageURL="/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/paint1.png" />

1. Open the ABC logo in Paint and select the Colour Picker tool.
1. Click on the colour you are looking to determine the value of.
1. Then click on 'Edit Colours'.  The dialog will show the RGB values for the colour you just picked.
l. The RGB values will be displayed in edit colour dialog.

<DisplayImage imageURL="/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/paint2.png" />
</details>
:::

#### The Display Table
The other area of our app that could do with some colour goodness is our 
table on our final screen. It doesn't look that great:

<DisplayImage imageURL="/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/coding15.png" size="75%" />

We could use the logo colours to add a border around the table and style the table cells.

:::info
We need to know a little about the structure of [HTML tables](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp).
Specifically, we need to be aware that rows in tables are defined inside `<tr></tr>` tags,
column headers are defined inside `<th></th>` elements and table cells in `<td></td>`.

When we style a table we have a 'parent style' which controls the table over all and we also have 'child styles'
which style the elements in the table. 

It turns out that Docassemble styles table using the default `table` class.  This is the table's parent
style and we'd define it in the usual way ie:
```css
.table {
  /* style stuff goes here */
}
```
For the child elements we define them as children of `table` in this way:
```css
.table tr {
  /* styles for table rows */
}
.table th {
  /* styles for table column headings */
}
.table td {
  /* styles for table cells */
} 
```
:::

We'll need to define some more colours as well.  Using our colour picker we can pick another 
three colours from the ABC logo and add them to our `:root` class.
```css
:root {
  --ABC-darkest: rgb(10,62,92);
  --ABC-darker: rgb(9,115,150);
  --ABC-light: rgb(25,175,189);
  --ABC-sun: rgb(205,146,79);
  --ABC-sun-lighter: rgb(248,238,228);
}
```
:::info
`--ABC-sun-lighter` is a lighter version of `--ABC-sun`.  It was calculated by using the 
slider on the colour picker in Microsoft Paint to slide up to a lighter shade of 
`--ABC-sun-light`.
:::

What would be good would to have a dark border around the table.  The column headings
should also be dark with white text.  The table rows should be banded using a light 
colour, and we'll make the font a little smaller in the table cells to distinguish them
from the column headers. Let's define styles for this:

```css
/* This style sets the border for the table */
.table {
    border: 5px solid var(--ABC-darkest);
}

/* This makes the column headings dark and the text white */
.table th {
  background-color: var(--ABC-darkest);
  color: white;
}

/* We shrink the text a little in the table cells */
.table td {
  font-size: 0.8em;
}

/* Docassemble is highlighting every odd cell in grey.
 * we are going to use a lighter version of the colour
 * of the sun in the ABC logo */
.table tr:nth-child(odd) {
  background-color: var(--ABC-sun-lighter);
}
```
Our table looks a bit nicer now.

<DisplayImage imageURL="/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/coding16.png" size="75%" />

:::note
#### A note on banding rows
This is a relatively advanced concept for this textbook and won't be discussed in detail.
If you would like to know more there are [resources online](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_table_zebra.asp)
that you may find useful.  It is also always useful to poke around any website with 
banded table rows with your Developer Tools.
:::

## Descriptive text
We will leave the adding of text to the welcome screen and the user questions to the reader.
We will focus on the end screen as that is where the relevant information is presented.

We have been using the screen for test output so far.  Now we need to prepare a screen
that is appropriate for the display of the relevant information.  We would want our
screen to contain:
* some brief text describing the information provided;
* we may want to include a table showing the user's answers to the questions;
* we want to display the table of relevant services; and
* we want display the PDF attachment (which we have not yet created).

We will cover the PDF attachment below.  Let's deal with the other three.

###  Brief text
Again, this is not a technical task and is left to the reader.

### A table with answers
Given the data we want to display is not in any data structure it's best to use
a Markdown table to display the user's input.  Something like this would work:
```yml
  You entered the following information

  Age|Gender|Service Locations|Type of Accommodation
  ---|---|---|---
  ${MJFage}|${MJFgender}|${MJFlocation.true_values()}|${MJFfamily_display}

```
`${MJFfamily_display}` is new.  If we displayed `MJFfamily` in our table it would display
the string `family` or `single`.  This is not particularly descriptive, so we'll use
a code block to set `MJFfamily_display` to more descriptive text.  Add this code block
to the end of `main.yml`:
```yml
---
code: |
  if MJFfamily == 'family':
    MJFfamily_display = 'Accommodation for your family'
  elif MJFfamily == 'single
    MJFfamily_display = 'Accommodation for yourself'
  else:
    MJFfamily_display = 'Error invalid value for MJFfamily: {}'.format(MJFfamily)
---
```
If `MJFfamily` is set to `family` then the string `Accommodation for your family` will be displayed.
If `MJFfamily` is `single` then`Accommodation for yourself` will be displayed.  If `MJFfamily` 
is any other value then an error message will be displayed.

:::note
In theory we should never encounter the error message.  However it is good practice to
account for every possible case when writing an if statement.  The `else:` catches
any other value.

This is good practice as, for example, if we added a new category to accommodation type
and forgot to modify this part of the code at least we would receive the error message
and be alerted to updating this if statement as well.
:::

### The relevant services table
Our [`relevant_services_test_table`](00-50#testing) is close to what we want.
The only changes would be remove the Website column and
make the service name a link to the service's website.  We can do this with a Python expression,
much like how we used an expression to display the age range.  In this case we will use
a Python expression to create the Markdown syntax for displaying a web link.

:::info
The best reference for setting up web links is in your Playground:
<details>
<summary>
Playground screenshot
</summary>
<DisplayImage imageURL="/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/coding17.png" />
</details>

However, there are [many](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link)
[other](https://www.markdownguide.org/) [resources](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github)
[available](https://www.howtogeek.com/448323/what-is-markdown-and-how-do-you-use-it/) online.
:::

  We will add a new table block to 
display this modified table.  We will put the table block in `process_data.yml`.  Note the use
of `format()` to create a hyperlink for the 'Name' column:
```yml {6}
---
table: relevant_services_table
rows: MJFrelevant_services
columns:
  - Name: |
      "[{}]({})".format(row_item['name'], row_item['website'])
  - Age Range: |
      "{} to {}".format(row_item['min_age'], row_item['max_age'])
  - Gender: row_item['gender']
  - Locations: row_item['location']
  - Family: row_item['family']
---
```
Now that we have a 'real' table to display we can remove our `services_test_table` and
`relevant_services_test_table` and replace it with our `relevant_services_table`.  Our
`final_screen` should now look something like this:
```yml
---
event: final_screen
question: Final Screen
subquestion: |
  Some introductory text will go here.

  You entered the following information

  Age|Gender|Service Locations|Type of Accommodation
  ---|---|---|---
  ${MJFage}|${MJFgender}|${MJFlocation.true_values()}|${MJFfamily_display}

  Here are a list of services relevant to your circumstances.

  ${relevant_services_table}
buttons:
  - Exit: exit
  - Restart: restart
---
```

Make these changes and run the app.  You should end up with something that looks like this:

<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/coding14.png' />

The app is an improvement on the unstyled version and, frankly, reflects the limits of this
author's artistic abilities!  Nonetheless, this does demonstrate how it is possible
to significantly improve the look of an application.

We have one more part left.  The PDF attachment.

## PDF attachment.
We have covered attachments [previously](/docs/textbook/chapter_02/00-30) and have dealt with
them in more detail in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_08' />. For our app we want to use
a Word document template to generate a PDF file which the user can download or email to 
themselves.

As we know, we usually use Word documents to create the templates from which to generate
PDFs (although there are [other options](https://docassemble.org/docs/documents.html)).

We'll want our Word document to look more or less like our final screen.  Our document should 
make use of the same logo colours.  However, we cannot use Google Fonts in Word documents, so
we will stick to the default fonts.

Generate a quick mockup that looks something like this in Word:

<DisplayImage imageURL="/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/pdf1.png" />

It's a bit subtle but we've set the colour of 'Emergency Accommodation Service' to
the same RGB values as `--ABC-darkest`.

Let's also record a document generation date in the footer:

<DisplayImage imageURL="/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/pdf2.png" />

We'll work through these from the simplest to the most complicated.

### Document Generation date
We can use Jinja code, [`format_date()`](https://docassemble.org/docs/functions.html#format_date),
and [`today()`](https://docassemble.org/docs/functions.html#today) to generate today's date and
format it in an AGLC-compliant way.  

We can replace the highlighted text in the footer of our document with this Jinja code:
```jinja
{{ format_date(today(), 'd MMMM YYYY')}}
```

### Answers to user questions
We want to set up a table similar to the user question table in our final screen.  We should
style it in a similar way, that is with `--ABC-darkest` colour for the column header and border
backgrounds.

We should style our table as follows:
* dark column headers as already discussed
* a 3 pixel border around the table (not the cells) of the same colour
* each column must be the same width (Select the table,
Go to Layout (on the right of 'Table Design') -> Distribute Columns).

:::note
`---ABC-darkest` is defined in CSS.  Word does not understand CSS so we will need to define
custom colours using the RGB values from CSS in each element
:::

We can use Jinja code to display our variable values in the cells.  Your table should look
something like this:

<DisplayImage imageURL="/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/pdf3.png" />

:::note
We are using `MJFfamily_display` in this table for the same reason as we use it in `final_screen`.
:::

### The Relevant Services Table
We want to use a similar layout to the `final_screen` here as well.  There are two
issues we need to address:  firstly, we don't know how big our table will be - it will need
to display only the number of rows it requires to display the services (ie: no blank 
rows or missing rows); secondly, we want to display the service name as a hyperlink to 
the service's website.

Let's start with a skeleton table first:

<DisplayImage imageURL="/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/pdf4.png" />

To this we can add the Jinja code that will generate the required  number of rows in the table.

:::info
Attachments and Jinja are covered in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_08' />.
:::

Merge the top and bottom rows in the table and insert the code as shown below:

<DisplayImage imageURL="/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/pdf5.png" />

We now need to populate each of the cells.  Where a cell's value is a variable name,
such as for Gender, Location and Family, we can enclose the variable name in Jinja
braces ie:
* `{{a_service['gender']}}` for Gender;
* `{{a_service['location']}}` for Locations; and
* `{{a_service['family']}}` for Accommodation Type;

For the 'Age Range' column we don't need to use `format()`. Instead we can create the string
directly, much like if this was Markdown and Mako ie:
```
{{a_service['min_age']}} to {{a_service['max_age']}}
```

So, for all but the 'Service' column, our table should look like this:

<DisplayImage imageURL="/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/pdf6.png" />

:::note
We will sort the column spacing later.
:::

### Making a Jinja hyperlink
In order to make a hyperlink with Jinja we need to supply the markdown to Jinja and pass it through
a markdown [filter](https://docassemble.org/docs/documents.html#markdown%20to%20docx).  In our
database we have a `name` key and we have a `website` key but we don't have any key with a value
that would be Markdown text for a hyperlink (ie: `[name](https://link.to.website)`).

We could go back to `MJFservices` and manually add a new, say, `service_link` key for every entry
and with the proper markdown link.  However, that shouldn't be mecessary, as we'd just be duplicating
information we already have.

Ideally, what we would like would be to create this `service_link` key/value pair dynamically as we
need it, much like how we created `MJFfamily_display` just when we needed it.

#### Using index variables
Docassemble does allow us to do this.  Firstly, we [know how to add](/docs/textbook/chapter_05/00-40#adding-items)
new items to a dictionary.  Secondly, we also know how to [reference data in a list](/docs/textbook/chapter_05/00-20#referencing).
Docassemble provides us with [index variables](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#index%20variables) that
allow us to refer to items in a list in question and code block.  If we put all that together, we can construct
a code block like this:
```yml showLineNumbers
---
code: |
  MJFservices[i]['service_link'] = "[{}]({})".format(
    MJFservices[i]['name'],
    MJFservices[i]['website']
  )
---
```
Let's work through this.  Overall, what this code block is doing is setting
the value of `MJFservices[i]['service_link']`.  The value it is being set to
is essentially just a `format()` command, but the command is spread over three
lines as the two parameters to pass in are rather long.  We could have written
the `format()` part like this:
```python
  "[{}]({})".format( MJFservices[i]['name'], MJFservices[i]['website'] )
```
The real fun is in this `[i]` business.  The `i` is an [index variable](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#index%20variables).
This is a special variable that is not set in a code, question or object block like the
other variables we dealt with so far.  An index variable is used to refer to the position,
or 'index' of a list item.  So, what our code block is doing is 
setting the value of the i<sup>th</sup> list item of `MJFservices` to something.

As we know, `MJFservices` is a list of dictionaries.  So, more specifically, our
code block is setting the value of the `service_link` key for the i<sup>th</sup>
list item in `MJFservices`.

How does Docassemble know what the i<sup>th</sup> item is?  This is something that
it works out internally. As Docassemble iterates over a list it keeps track of the 
index of each list item.  We don't see this when we write:
```python
for a_service in MJFservices
  # do something
```
But Python is aware of the index nonetheless.  What this means for us is that we can
iterate over a list and use code with index variables for blocks to ask questions 
for each item or, in our case, code blocks to automatically popluate new items.

For example:
```yml showLineNumbers
---
code: |
  for a_service in MJFservices:
    a_service['service_link']
---
code: |
  MJFservices[i]['service_link'] = "[{}]({})".format(
    MJFservices[i]['name'],
    MJFservices[i]['website']
  )
---
```
The first code block iterates over `MJFservices`.  The body of the loop asks for 
`a_service['service_link']` to be populated.  Docassemble, on seeing this code,
will execute the second code block as it is looking to populate the `service_link`
key for a particular element of `MJFservices`. The element is passed in to `i`
so the correct list item is populated.

This works in Jinja also.  The first row in our table has this:
```
{%tr for a_service in MJFrelevant_services %}
```
This is the beginning of a for loop.

Each cell in the body row of our loop refers to `a_service`, much like we did
in our decision processing block [earlier](00-50).  For the 'Service Name' column
we can refer to `a_service['service_link']`.  Docassemble will see this and
process our new code block.

#### Applying a markdown filter.
Now that we have a way of passing our Markdown hyperlink into Jinja we need to tell Jinja to apply 
a Markdown filter, otherwise it will be processed as plain text.  This part is much simpler than 
the index variable!  We apply a Markdown filter like so:
```
{{p a_service['service_index'] | markdown}}
```
<DisplayImage imageURL="/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/pdf7.png" />

### Adding the attachment
Finally, we need to connect our template to our app and provide the email capability.
Thankfully, Docassemble's [`attachment`](https://docassemble.org/docs/documents.html#attachment)
specifier provides an emailing and Word-to-PDF capability that we can use. All we need to do
is add this `attachment` to our `final_screen` above our `buttons`:
```yml showLineNumbers
attachment:
  docx template file: ABCtemplate.docx
  filename: "ABC Inc Emergency Accommodation Services"
  valid formats:
    - pdf
```
Line 2 tells Docassemble our attachment will be based on our Word template file we have just created.

Line 3 will save (or email) the PDF we generate with this filename.

Lines 4 and 5 tell Docassemble to only generate a [PDF](https://docassemble.org/docs/documents.html#valid%20formats).
By default, both Word and PDF files would be generated.

This attachment block appends this to the bottom of our final screen:

<DisplayImage imageURL="/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/pdf8.png" />

Clicking on the PDF will display our PDF, and it can be saved with the filename
we speicified:

<DisplayImage imageURL="/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/pdf9.png" />

## The End!
That concludes this case study.  Those of you wishing to take this study further could address
some issues not covered in this case study:

* What will happen if there are no relevant services for a user?  What is displayed in
this situation?  What should be displayed in this situation?
* The spinner that is displayed before the final screen is partially hidden under
the navbar.  It should be moved downwards.

And, of course, the app could always look better...
