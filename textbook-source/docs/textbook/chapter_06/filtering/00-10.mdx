## ABC's Requirements 

To summarise the key points, ABC require:

* an application that displays a list of emergency accommodation providers tailored
to the circumstances of the user;
* ABC's existing emergency accommodation database has emergency accommodation
providers organised agaisnt these categories:
  * the minimum and maximum ages of clients each service will accept;
  * the genders each service will accept;
  * whether the servics accommodates families or individuals only; and
  * in which part of Adelaide the service is located. ABC's location data is
  broken down into north, south, east and west.
* a user should be able to select multiple locations if they wish; and
* ABC want to maintain the data themselves.

## Example Data
ABC have given us a spreadsheet containing a list of service providers, their 
details and the above criteria.

<Tables.ServiceTable />

## Designing the App
Let's walk through designing the app.  We do this by starting out with our high level
requirements.  We drill down into each requirement, breaking it down into more and
more detail until we get to a point where we have enough detail to write code.

We'll work through a series of flowcharts to illustrate this.

At the highest level we have this:
<Flowcharts.F01 />

We can draw some assumptions from this highest level:

* **list** implies iteration;
* **tailored to** implies a decision tree or some decision-making process; and
* **circumstances of** implies asking the user questions which likely to feed the
decision-making process.

We can also get an idea of how the app will run ie:
1. ask the user about their circumstances;
1. evaluate the user's circumstances against the list of services and make a
decision on which services are relevant and should be displayed
1. Display the list of relevant services to the user

<Flowcharts.F02 />

Let's deal with each of these in turn

## Ask the user about their circumstances
We need to ask users questions so we can provide them with a relevant list
of services.  The questions we need to ask must relate to the criteria 
against which the services are organised ie: age, gender, location and family,
as ultimately we will filter out irrelevant based on these criteria.

<Flowcharts.F03 />

We probably know enough now to make some notes as to how we are going to code
these questions.  For example we can choose variable names and data types.

<Flowcharts.F03a />

We've managed to get to a level of detail sufficient for us to write code to
implement this user circumstances part of our app.  We can leave things here
for now and drill down into the other parts.

## Evaluate circumstances against list of services
We can break this part down into two sub-parts:

<Flowcharts.F04 />

Let's deal with each of these in turn

### Define a list of Services
If you refer back to <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_05' /> you will see some
similarity between ABC's data and
the [multidimensional data structures](/docs/textbook/chapter_05/00-50#multidimensional-data) we discussed in
that chapter.  It follows, therefore, that we should use a <DisplayGlossaryItem item='datablock' />
to store our customer data.

In addition we will store our data block in a separate file.  This will make it (slightly) easier
for ABC staff to find and modify their list of services.

The columns in our [data table](#example-data) will map to keys in our data structure. Some keys will be
used to store simple data structures, such as strings and integers, and others will store complex data
structures.  Here are some thoughts on how we can map ABC's data table into a data block:

<Tables.MappingTable />

Let's call our data block `MJFservices`.  The first entry in our data block would look something like this:
```yml
variable name: MJFservices
use objects: True
data:
  - name: ABC Services
    website: https://abcsvc.org.au
    min_age: 18
    max_age: 65
    gender:
      - Male
      - Female
    location:
      - North
      - East
    family:
      - Family
      - Single
```

Like our [user circumstances](#evaluate-circumstances-against-list-of-services) we are now at a level of
detail where we can start writing code.  So, let's leave the data structure for now and let's look
at how our data will be processed.

### Evaluate against service criteria
This aspect forms the heart of our app. This is where we make the decisions about what our user
should be presented with.  It's where we determine which services are relevant and which are not.

Let's map out what this would look like:

<Flowcharts.F05 />

Once again it looks like we can break this out into two parts: a loop and a loop body
(ie: the logic to be performed inside the loop)

<Flowcharts.F05a />

We have already encountered ['for loop' syntax](/docs/textbook/chapter_05/00-30#for-loop-syntax) and we can see that
we can express the loop part of our flow diagram as a `for loop'.

<Flowcharts.F05b />

That syntax states we will place each service into the `a_service` special variable as we iterate over the
`MJFservices` list.

That's our for loop ready to code!  Now let's look at the loop body

#### Loop Body
Let's isolate the loop body:

<Flowcharts.F06 />

The first part we need to deal with is the question 'Does the service meet the user's circumstances?'.
Let's break that down further.  What are these 'circumstances'?  As discussed previously, these are:
* the user's age;
* the user's gender;
* the desired locations of the services; and
* whether the user is looking for family or single accommodation.

It follows then that our 'circumstances' question is actually four questions.  Let's
revisit our loop body.  Because this is the loop body, each service we deal with will 
be placed in `a_service` as we iterate over `MJFservices`.

Also, as you recall from [above](#ask-the-user-about-their-circumstances), the user's information
is stored in `MJFage`, `MJFgender`, `MJFlocation` and `MJFfamily`.

<Flowcharts.F06a />

We are asking a set of 'yes/no' questions.  As soon as you see 'yes/no' you should be thinking
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='boolean' plurals />.  'Yes' is `True` and 'No' is `False` in our context.

We need to ask each of the four questions first and then check their answers to determine if 
this particular service meets our criteria.  Let's do that as follows:

<Flowcharts.F06b />

Now we need to work out how to ask each question.

#### The age question
This one is pretty simple.  We need to check is `MJFage` falls between `min_age` and `max_age`.
We should include each of `min_age` and `max_age` in our limits.  For example, a user should
qualify for ABC Services if they are 18, not 19.

We also need to deal with the 'or over' that appears in our data table.  We'll choose the least
sophisticated way to do this and where an agency has an 'or over' in its age limit we'll set
`max_age` to 999.  Even biblical figures never lived that long!

We're then left with a rather simple [mathematical test](/docs/textbook/chapter_03/00-30#mathematical-tests) to apply.
We want to apply one of the 'In between' tests we covered in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_03' /> ie:
```python
MJFage_ok = 18 <= MJFage <= 65
```
This statement evaluates whether MJFage is between 18 and 65 inclusive and stores the result (`True` or `False`)
in `MJFage_ok`.

#### The gender question
This question is only slightly more complicated.  The user is asked to choose one gender and
their response is stored in `MJFgender`.  Each service in `MJFservices` stores applicable genders as
a list in each record's `gender` key.  Consequently, we need to test for [list membership](/docs/textbook/chapter_05/00-20#list-membership)
as we discussed in <DisplayChapter chatper='chapter_05' />.  We could do something like this:
```python
MJFgender_ok = MJFgender in a_service['gender']
```
This statement tests to see if `MJFgender` is a member of the list in `a_service['gender']` and stores the
result in `MJFgender_ok`.

:::note
Remember that we refer to values of dictionary keys using the [key name](/docs/textbook/chapter_05/00-40#referencing)
:::

#### The location question
This question is a bit more complex than the others.  This is because ABC wants users to look
for services in more than one location.  We have already [decided](#ask-the-user-about-their-circumstances)
to use the [`checkboxes`](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#fields%20checkboxes)
data type to collect location data.  This means we'll be presented with a dictionary of locations, each with
a `True` or `False` assigned indicating wether that location was selected.

We need to check each location the user has selected and check if that location is in the `location` list
for each `a_service`.  The test is similar to the gender test above but we need to run that test for 
each location the user has selected:

<Flowcharts.F07 />

#### The family question
This logic is very simliar to the gender question as, like the gender question, `MJFfamily` contains only one
value which must be matched against items `a_service['family']`.  The code will end up looking something
like this:
```python
MJFfamily_ok = MJFfamily in a_service['family']
```

#### The decision
We will use an <DisplayGlossaryItem item='ifstatement' /> to code our decision.  The if statement will
test that each of `MJFage_ok`, `MJFgender_ok`, `MJFlocation_ok` and `MJFfamily_ok` are `True`.  To do this
we use a series of `and` [logic tests](/docs/textbook/chapter_03/00-30#logic-tests) chained together.  If
the test passes then we'll add `a_service` to the list of services to display.  If the test fails we won't
do anything and just allow the loop to skip to the next `a_service` to process.  Our code will look 
something like this:
```python
if MJFage_ok and MJFgender_ok and MJFlocation_ok and MJFfamily_ok:
    # This is where we will put the code to add a_service to 
    # the list of services to display
```
This concludes determining the 'Evaluate circumstances' part of our app.  As we stated before,
this part is the most complex part of our app as this is where all the decision-making takes 
place.  We've had to drill down quite a few levels to get to a level of detail that we can code,
which is a reflection of the complexity.  Nonetheless, we will reap the rewards for going into
this level of detail when we code.  We've done all our thinking work already.  At coding time
we'll just need to concentrate on translating our flowcharts into code.

Before we do that, let's look at the final component of our app - displaying the list of relevant services.

## Display the list of relevant services
ABC would like us to display the services in a way that shows the service's name as well as
the criteria for acceptance.  The user should be able to click on the name and be taken to the
service's website.

ABC have also stated that they would like the display page to look nice.  They have told us that
their website uses the [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) for headings and 
[Unna](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Unna) for body text.  ABC have also supplied us with
their logo:

<DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/ABCInc_logo_white.png' size="50%" />

Our final page should make use of the colours in the logo, although not all the colours are
required to be used.  That is up to us.

ABC have also said they would like the list to be displayed in a PDF which the user can either
print out or email to themselves.

We have now completed the design of our app.  It's time to start coding it.
