The next part of our [design](00-10) is to set up the data and evaluate it.  This is a rather
hefty part of our app and we will break this up into mulitple parts, as we did in the design.

In this part we will set out the `MJFservices` database.

## The database
In our design we made decisions on our [database structure](00-10#define-a-list-of-services) and even
started writing code for `MJFservices`.  Let's fill out `MJFservices` with all the data in our table.

Let's keep our table handy for reference:
<Tables.ServiceTable />

Now, let's build out our code.  As per our [introduction](00-20) we are going to store our database in
`services.yml`

```yml title="services.yml" showLineNumbers
---
variable name: MJFservices
use objects: True
data:
  - name: ABC Services
    website: https://abcsvc.org.au
    min_age: 18
    max_age: 65
    gender:
      - Male
      - Female
    location:
      - North
      - East
    family:
      - family
      - single
  - name: WH Youth
    website: https://whyouth.org.au
    min_age: 12
    max_age: 17
    gender:
      - Male
      - Female
      - Other
    location:
      - South
    family:
      - single
  - name: "St Mary's Shelter"
    website: https://stmarys.org.au
    min_age: 12
    max_age: 999
    gender:
      - Female
      - Other
    location:
      - North
    family:
      - Single
  - name: "MHI Men's Health"
    website: https://mhimh.org.au
    min_age: 18
    max_age: 999
    gender:
      - Male
    location:
      - North
      - West
    family:
      - Single
  - name: DE Family Shelter
    website: https://defsupport.org.au
    min_age: 18
    max_age: 65
    gender:
      - Male
      - Female
    location:
      - North
      - East

      - South

      - family

## Testing
As we did with our question variables we'd like to display our services data in our `final_screen`
to make sure we have set our database out correctly.  We'll display the services in a table format
as doing so makes it easier to check against the table ABC gave us.

We have discussed [Markdown tables](/docs/textbook/chapter_02/00-42#displaying-output-in-a-table) previously.
Markdown tables are useful for displaying table output but, as we have our data in a
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='datablock' /> we can make use of a [`table` block](https://docassemble.org/docs/initial.html#table)
which is simpler to create and less cluttered than a Markdown table.

To summarise the Docassemble manual, a `table` block allows us to set out the columns we'd like in our
table and the table's data source, and the table block will render the table for us.

So let's set up our table block first:
```yml title="tests.yml" showLineNumbers
---
table: services_test_table
rows: MJFservices
columns:
  - Name: row_item['name']
  - Website: row_item['website']
  - Age Range: |
      "{} to {}".format(row_item['min_age'], row_item['max_age'])
  - Gender: row_item['gender']
  - Locations: row_item['location']
  - Family: row_item['family']
---
```
And then we can call our `services_test_table` from our `final_screen`
```yml showLineNumbers {15}
---
# This is our final screen
event: final_screen
question: Final Screen
subquestion: |
  Eventually the list of services will be displayed here

  Our variables:

  * ${MJFage}
  * ${MJFgender}
  * ${MJFlocation}
  * ${MJFfamily}

  ${services_test_table}
buttons:
  - Exit: exit
  - Restart: restart
---
```
We will also need to include `services.yml` and `tests.yml` in our `include` block in `main.yml`:
```yml
---
include:
  - questions.yml
  - services.yml
  - tests.yml
---
```
Make these changes and run the app.  If you didn't delete the questions from `final_screen` the app will
ask you the four user questions again.  It should then display the question values and the table:

<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_06/filter/coding4.png' />

The table doesn't look pretty (we'll sort that later) but it does the job.

## About Table Blocks
We want to draw out a few properties of table blocks.  These are discussed in the [manual](https://docassemble.org/docs/initial.html#table)
but it's worth discussing them in the context of our app.

### `row_item`
This is a special variable Docassemble creates with the table block.  Each row is placed into `row_item`
as the table is rendered.  For our purposes all we need to know is that if we want to access data in
a table row we can use `row_item`.

Note also that each table row (ie: list item) is a dictionary, we can refer to the contents of each
row using dictionary keys, which is what we're doing here.

### The Age Range row
In all the other rows we simply tell Docassemble to display the value of each key.  In the Age range we 
want to display a string that says '*min_age* to *max_age*'.  We use a python string and
[`format()`](/docs/textbook/chapter_03/00-20#using-format) to join the two age values and display 
them in our string.

### The list data (Gender, Location and Family)
If you have run the app already you'll notice that the list data, such as gender, is displayed
so that it reads as a sentence, with each item separated by commas and the last item separated
by an 'and' eg: 'Male, Female and Other'.  This is one of the benefits of the `use objects: True`
line we included in our <DisplayGlossaryItem item='datablock' />.  Setting `use objects` to
`True` means that our lists are stored as [`DAList`s](https://docassemble.org/docs/objects.html#DAList)
and our dictionaries as [`DADict`s](https://docassemble.org/docs/objects.html#DADict).  `DAList` and
`DADict` are Docassemble's enhanced versions of Python lists and dictionaries respectively.  They
come with extra functionality, one of these being to display output in a comma-separated sentence as
we have seen.

:::info
One of the benefits of using `DADict` is that we get to display selected locations using
the `true_values()` method.  Had we been using a 'vanilla' Python dictionary we would
have had to write the equivalent code ourselves.
