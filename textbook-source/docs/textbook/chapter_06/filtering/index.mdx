In this case study we investigate using data in a <DisplayGlossaryItem item='datablock' /> and filtering the data
for display to the user.

This case study builds on the iteration and data storage concepts we introduced in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_05' />.

## ABC Incorporated

We have been engaged by ABC Incorporated, a not-for-profit association that works in the 
Disability sector.

A lot of ABC's clients are looking for emergency accommodation for various reasons.  It may be
that they have been evicted for not paying rent, or they may be facing a domestic violence
situation, or they simply may not have anywere to stay for a few nights.

ABC have a list of emergency accommodation providers but different providers cater for different
kinds of people.  For example, some only cater for families, some may only cater for people
of a particular gender and so on.

ABC have come to us and asked us to write an app that would present to a user
a list of accommodation providers relevant just to them.  For example, a single
male living at Gepps Cross would only be presented with a list of accommodation providers
that cater for single males and located in the north of Adelaide.

ABC can provide us with a list of providers.  ABC will need to maintain that list, so
we need to make the maintenance process as simple as possible for them.

To summarise the key points, ABC require:

* an application to display a list of emergency accommodation providers tailored
to the circumstances of each user;
* ABC's existing emergency accommodation database has emergency accommodation
providers organised agaisnt these categories.
  * the user's age;
  * the user's gender;
  * whether the user is seeking accommodation for themselves or themselves and their
  family; and
  * in which part of Adelaide does the user require accommodation. ABC's data is
  broken down into north, south, east and west.
  
Other requirements are:

* a user shoudl be able to select multiple locations if they wish; and
* ABC want to maintain the data themselves.
