title: "Ch 3d: Iteration"

Focus on lists as that makes more sense.  Introduce the notion of wanting to do
something on each element of a list.  Maybe have an example of wanting to 
display every row in a spreadsheet in a table (I think the scripts have this)

## Iteration using for loops
- a simple list displayed in an Excel screenshot
    - list of strings
- display the same list in python code
- we want to display this as a table

## Mako for loops

:::caution
We have a problem here.  Logically, the best way to introduce for loops is
inside a code block (so we have genuine python code), but the logical next 
step to render the list above in a table is to introduce Mako `% for` instead.

The concepts are the same but it appears messy to me.

## Iteration using groups?
This is hard stuff but I do cover it. It's also powerful if students can get
to understand it.

## Iteration using table blocks
Also advanced stuff.  But a really good shortcut and something we cover in the
videos.
