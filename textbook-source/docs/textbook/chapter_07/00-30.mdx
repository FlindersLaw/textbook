title: Application Source Code
---
This page contains the final code for our app.  As you've noticed, the code is spread across two files and
depends on a Flinders logo file as well.

Unlike the code snippets in this chapter, this complete code has been extensively commented.

## `chapter7.yml`
Copy this file into `chapter7.yml` in your Playground

# A wide range of metadata can be set for your code.  In this example
# we set the title, short title and (potentially)disable login prompts.
# For more information on metadata visit

# Declare your logo as an object.  This is required to display the
# logo in the navbar along with the title (by default, Docassemble
# displays *either* the Title text or the logo)).  The image file

objects:
  - MJFlogo: DAStaticFile.using(filename='flinders_logo.png')

# We want to set a logo also.  The Docassemble manual (Initial Blocks [1])
# says we can use a 'logo' key.  That only works when using an image file
# that's not in the package (ie: on the internet somewhere).  As our logo is
# uploaded in our package we need this code block to set our logo.
#
# Note also at the end of set_parts() below we control the height of our logo
# using the 'height' style

# Features can turn on or off many, well, features in Docassemble.  
# Our example includes a CSS file and (potentially) turns off the menus in the navbar.
# The CSS file is in the 'Static' folder in the playground.

# Customising the look and feel
mandatory: True
question: Look and Feel Demonstrator
subquestion: |
  This question block demonstrates how to perform basic customisations to the look and feel
  of your app.  Most of the customisation is done using **Cascading Stylesheets**, or [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/).
  CSS is the standard way of customising the look and feel of webapps.  Have a look at
  the CSS file in the `static` forlder for this app to see more information about how we've used
  CSS to customise this app.

  You can also use [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/) together CSS to improve the display
  of your app.  In many cases HTML can be
  mixed with markdown.  You can use CSS to control how your raw HTML looks.  For example, the `div`
  block below is linked to a CSS style called `MJFbox`.  If you find `MJFbox` in the CSS
  file you will see the commands that set the border, text colour and font style.

  <div class="MJFbox">
  <p>This text appears in a <code>div</code> block and is formatted according to
  the <code>MJFbox</code> style.</p>
  
  <p><span class="MJFbolder">Note:</span> It's not always possible to use Markdown in <code>div</code>
  blocks.  In this block we've formatted our text using HTML.  Check out the source code to see
  which HTML tags we have used.</p>
  </div>
buttons:
  - Exit: exit
  - Restart: restart
  - Continue: continue

## `styles.css`
Copy this code into `styles.css` in the 'Static Files' folder of your Playground.

/* This file is a CSS or Cascading Style Sheet.  It is how
   the look and feel of web pages is controlled.  You don't need know
   too much about how CSS works.  We only use a little of it to contol
   the look and feel of our apps.  If you are interested in CSS there
   are many online references

       The whole spectrum of colours can be represented by any combination
       of RGB values.  To choose a colour you need to know its RGB value.
       To work that out, use MS Paint or Excel to set a colour.  Most software
       comes with colour picking software that will show you the RGB values
       for any colour you pick

 * special styles to particular content, much like we're doing here.

 * It also creates a border around the text and creates a nice shadow
 * around the border.
