title: Walk through an example app

import {DisplayImage} from '@site/src/components';
import {DisplayChapter} from '@site/src/components';
import {DisplayGlossaryItem} from '@site/src/components';
import ListOfChanges from './_list_of_changes.mdx';

Let's start start with an app that looks like this:

<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_07/lnfdemo1.png' size="70%" />

and let's turn it into this:

<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_07/lnfdemo2.png' size="70%" />

Specifically, what we want to do is the following:

<ListOfChanges />

## Finding the components

Before we get into modifying styles we need to identify the styles to modify.  One way to do so
would be to identify the various styles as per the [Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs).
This documentation is a little heavy for our purposes though as it's directed at professional developers.
Nonetheless you are welcome to make your way through it if you wish.

In our experience we find it more useful to inspect a website directly using the 'Developer Tools'k
that are in most web browsers. Developer Tools allow you to 'inspect' a web page and view its components.
Most developer tools allow you click on a place in the web page and will then bring up the underlying code
for that web page in a special pane.  The underlying code usually looks something like this: 

<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_07/developertools1.png'
    caption="Developer Tools Pane with code for navbar highlighted" />

You will notice a large number of `<div>` tags, starting with the `dabody` `<div>` on the second line.  
`<div>` tags, or 'Divs' are the way a web page it laid out in its logical components.  With Docassemble
all the content of the webpage is located inside the `dabody` div, with child divs laying out the rest of
the content.

On the fourth line you can see the div for `navbar`.  This is the code for the Bootstrap Navbar.  We 
recognise this as the `navbar` div as `navbar` is the first word to appear in the `class=...` part of the
`<div>` tag.  The `class` specifier lists out all the CSS styles to be applied to a particular div.  The 
styles are ordered from most generic to most specific.  The most generic style usually the name of the
Bootstrap component, as it is here. 

The fifth line contains a div with `class=container danavcontainer...`  The first style is the most generic
Bootstrap component.  The second style starts with `da` and that tells us that this style is a style used
explicitly by Docassemble to modify the Bootstrap theme.  This is important to us as, when customising styles,
we should always aim to customise a `da` style instead of a parent Bootstrap style.

## Accessing Developer Tools
Each web browser has its own Developer Tools.  In Chrome the Developer Tools are accessible from the 'three dots'
menu -> More Tools -> Developer Tools.  Developer tools are also available in the same place on Microsoft Edge. 
In Firefox the Developer Tools are accessed via the 'Hamburger' menu -> More Tools -> Developer Tools.

Where to find Developer Tools in your browser

<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_07/developertools_firefox.png'
    caption="Firefox Developer Tools" />
<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_07/developertools_chrome.png'
    caption="Chrome Developer Tools" />
<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_07/developertools_edge.png'
    caption="Edge Developer Tools" />
</details>

Developer Tools usually launch on the right side of your browser.  If they don't, look for a menu with a 'Dock to Right' option,
such as this in Firefox:

<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_07/developertools2.png' />

:::note
You will find that most browser screenshots for this textbook come from the Firefox browser.
The authors of this textbook prefer Firefox for practical reasons, such as its speed, low memory footprint
and the ability to view variable output from Docassemble in an easy to read way (see <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_09' />).
We also prefer it because, unlike Chrome, Edge and Safari, Firefox has very strong privacy protections and
does not collect user data as browsers such as Chrome, Safari and Edge do.

Nonetheless, what we demonstrate in this texbook, and run on Docassemble, will run equally as well in
any modern browser.  The authors have run Docassemble on Firefox, Edge and Chrome.  We are also aware that 
Docassemble, and this textbook, work fine on Safari.

## Creating custom styles
In order to modify the look of our app we will be creating custom CSS styles.  These styles need to be saved 
somewhere.  That 'somewhere' is the 'Static Files' folder in your Playground:

<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_07/staticfilesmenu.png' />

We can add a new CSS file by clicking on 'Add', choosing a name that ends in `.css`:

<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_07/addcssfile.png' />

The name of the file doesn't matter. We will tell our Docassemble program the name of the file we're using later.

Once we have a file saved we are ready to go.
