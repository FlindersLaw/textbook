title: Chapter 7. Making Your App Beautiful

While apps written in Docassemble look decent enough, it is usually better to 'dress them up'
a little to make them look more beautiful.  We might want to use a nicer colour combination, 
or add a client's logo, or make our app look like a client's website or have it conform to their
corporate style guide.

For example, instead of presenting an app that looks like this:

<DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/chapter_07/css1.png' size="70%" />

We might want it to look like this:

<DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/chapter_07/css2.png' size="70%"/>

We can make these stylistic changes using two technologies.  One is [**Bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/)
and the other is **Cascading Style Sheets**, more commonly known as [**CSS**](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS).

We won't go into either of these technologies in too much detail.  We'll go through just enough to tweak our
apps to change colours, fonts and other elements, and maybe add an image or two.  What we do need to know 
though is these two points.

First, **Bootstrap** elements are used to build our app.  For example, every app we build has a black
bar at the top (called a **Navbar**), a menu on the top right, and <DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_continue_prop} />,
<DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_restart_prop} /> and
<DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_exit_prop} /> buttons.  These are all elements provided to our app via Bootstrap
**theme**.  Docassemble comes bundled with a default theme which we have been using all this time.  It's what 
provides us with the black navbar, the colours for our buttons, the font we use and so-on.

We don't need to know much more about Bootstrap except that it provides us with these elements. We need to 
know this so we know how to refer to elements to change their styles.

Second, **CSS** is what we use to modify the look of our apps.  Bootstrap actually uses CSS to make its navbar
black, the Continue button blue and so-on.  We will also use CSS to change how our app looks.

The **Cascading** in CSS means that when we change an element we don't need to re-write it from scrath.  For example,
if we wanted to change the font in our Continue button, we only need to define a CSS style that defines the new font.
All the other style aspects of the button, such as its colour, its round edges and so-one, will 'cascade' down from
the default Bootstrap style and be applied together with our style.

So, in summary, Bootstrap tells us what elements we have, and we use CSS to change how those elements look.
