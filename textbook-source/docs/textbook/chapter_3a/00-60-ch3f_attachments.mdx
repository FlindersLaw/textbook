title: Attachments and Jinja
---

- start off with attaching - refer to ch2 example
  - named Attachments
  - displaying only as PDF
  - displaying inline

- cover off Jinja

Need to get into this in an advanced way
- using If statements
- using nested if statements and Iteration
- iterating using a table
- the %p tags

Also put something on debugging Jina ie: if you get an error and can't find it
in your code then check the Jinja.
