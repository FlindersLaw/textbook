## Variables

* Use bucket analogy.
  * Get Dall-E to generate pics

* Start with 'simple variables'.  Use bucket analogy.  Have table with bucket on one side and variable on the other.
* Show how put something in bucket == assigning a value to a variable.
* Introduce the term variable - it's like a bucket.
* Introduce the terms **assignment** and **value** - draw analogies ie:

    - assignment == putting stuff in the variable
    - value == what's put in the variable/bucket
    - put stuff in a bucket == assign a value to a variable.

- Some example code about assigning values to variables
- use the table I had in the videos
- but we go into more detail

- describe how we assign ie: we use `=` to assign a value to a variable - same as putting something in the bucket
- an admonition to emphasise that `=` puts stuff in a variable. It won't check to see if something is equal to something else.  To test for equality we use `==`.  We'll talk more about testing below.

## Simple and complex data
- may want to introduce 'simple' and 'complex' types
  - simple types are like putting one thing in the bucket.  That might be
    a number, or a word etc.  Basically it's one 'thing'

  - maybe introduce 'complex' data types here too.  Analogy would be putting a shopping list (ie: a list of items) or a spreadsheet printout.  The bucket now contains a list of things.  That's the one thing.  Likewise we can also store lists in python.  We can also store other data structures but we'll get to them later.
  - for now just remember that you can store simple data (numbers, strings etc) as well as complex data (lists but also others) in a variable.
  - have another table here?  On one side for the bucket have simple stuff, like an apple, or a pair of scissors.  On the other side we have strings, ints.  Then for complex stuff put a pic of a bucket with an excel spreadsheet in it.  On the variable side put a list.

:::note
maybe we put an exercise or two, or a code snippet showing how variables
are assigned

Also, we can say that Python guesses the data type?  Maybe down below.  And give some examples
:::

### Data types.
- we do the simple stuff first.  Introduce string (with note that we'll refer to text as strings from now on), ints, floats.  These should all be easy to grasp.  
- Then introduce boolean and explain what it is.
  - boolean variables great way to store yes/no answers.  As we'll see in code testing for the truth of a boolean is easier than testing that two strings equal each other
    - have example if that tests if a boolean is true, if a string == 'Yes'. Highlight testing for 'Yes' and 'yes' which are different.
    - include an admonition about case sensitivity.  Yes != yes!  
    - also include a discussion on truth and false?  For example No == No is true?  Might be confusing.

- Also mention that numbers can be in strings and they're not the same.  So, the integer 1 is not the same as the string '1'.  

:::note
Should we introduce some coding exercises here?  To test using booleans?

Actually, some coding exercises here generally would be good.  

- boolean
- compare boolean to string equality test
- show how the string 1 != #1

Should we set these up as DA code or should we give code snippets that they can paste into the python console? (https://www.python.org/shell).

Maybe we make code snippets that they can copy and paste into the Python shell but exercises remain on DA?

```python showLineNumbers title="Copy and paste into the Python Shell"
variable1 = 1   # This is an integer
variable2 = '1' # This is a string as it's surrounded by quotes
variable3 = 1   # This is also an integer.  It's the same as variable1
variable1 == variable2 # This will display 'false' as the two aren't equal
variable1 == variable3 # This will display 'true' as both variables contain integers

```
:::

### Strings
- they're always in quotes.
- best to use single quotes.
  - if they're not in quotes then python will think that you're writing a variable name.  Lots of syntax errors come about this way
  :::note
  show an example
  :::
- what happens if you need quotes in your string?
  - use double-quotes
  - or 'escape' the quote
  - show examples
- strings are text ie: words or letters.
- But numbers can be represented as strings too eg: (`'10'`). 
  - this is not the same as the number 10 (`10`).
  - you can check this by inputing `'10' == 10` in the python shell. It will return `False`

- Joining strings together (using '+')
- using `format()` in code and mako blocks
- basically what I have in B1.03.

### Ints, floats and currencies
- define an integer ie: a number with no decimal point ie: 1, 2, 3 (and also -1, -2, -3)
- define a floating point number, or real number in mathematics ie: a number with a decimal point
- note that currency isn't really a data type in python.  Currency is just a float but *formatted* as a currency
:::note
and maybe link to the DA manual as an example?
:::

### Touch on complex datatypes here as well.
- Show what a list looks like in code.
- Show what a dictionary (excel spreadsheet?) looks like
- but emphasise we're just showing this for now.  We'll get back to complex data types later.

## Testing variables
### Equality
- test for equality - emphasise `==` again
- show what happens in an if statement if you use the wrong test
```python
var1 = 1
var2 = 1
if var1 == var2:
    print("they are equal")

if var1 = var2:
    print("an error will be displayed")


```
Maybe show a screen dump from the python console?

### Numerical (Mathematical) tests
- After equality then we can show briefly the math symbols ie: `>`, `>=` etc.
- also show `n <= m <= o`?  That is, m is between n and o
  - also, get rid of the equals signs so m can't be equal to n or o.

- show not equals `!=`.  Compare against `==`

### Logic tests
- show ands and ors.  
  - show example of a test a == b and c == d.  
  - also show example of testing a against two values ie: a == b and a == d and emphasise (in admonition) that a == b and d is wrong.
    - maybe include a snippet to paste into the console?

- again, just a small exercise or two might be good?  We'd end up having a stack of exercises though.  Better might be to have either python snippets or DA snippets to paste into something and run.

- Do we need some examples here.  a table of english vs tests eg:

English|Python
---|---
The user's age is less than 66|`age < 66`
The user's name is 'Mark' | `name == 'Mark'`
The user's age is between 18 and 65 inclusive| `18 <= age <= 65`

### Testing for Yes and No
- In many cases you will be asking a user a question and expecting a Yes/No answer.  Give an example.
- show the different ways to collect a Yes/No answer (non-exhaustive)
  - with a `yesno` button
  - with radio buttons with 'Yes' and 'No' as values
  - with `yesnoradio`
- first two store the result as boolean, so we test for true or false.
- the middle one stores the result as a string ie: 'Yes' or 'No'
- so we need to check these in different ways
- show the tests for all three
  - omit the `== True` and just say this is implied for the boolean tests
  - so Booleans are neater and more concise when it comes to testing yes/no (or any 'is it or isn't it' question)
  - so we try to use Booleans when we encounter these kinds of questions
  - recommend `yesno` and `yesnoradio` over radio buttons for yes and no questions

:::tip 
We should put little quizzes throughout the textbook as we go so students can test their knowledge.

For example, the part on testing above, we could have three or four questions asking which of the tests are correct. And maybe even a quiz question where they have to input an answer.

Then, we could maybe set up a gameboard?  Most questions answered correctly wins?
:::

## Code blocks
Is this the best chapter for this?

We won't use them here but introduce them, distinguish them from question blocks.
Maybe show an example and say we'll be seeing a lot more of them as we progress.

## Python console
Do we want to introduce the Python console here too?  Not sure if it would
be confusing for students to have two different tools?

- emphasise the app runs in Docassemble
- but some code can be tested in the Python console?

Only problem is students wouldn't know enough to bring their scope into the
python console
