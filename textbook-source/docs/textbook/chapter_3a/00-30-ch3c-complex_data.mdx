title: "Ch 3c: Complex Data structures"
---

This will be a reprisal of the D* videos.  I thought that these were OK but
again maybe a bit more detail and a lot more examples. 

Great opportunity here to use images of lists, spreadsheets etc to show how 
data is represented.

We should cover data blocks in this chapter as well.  So, do something like:

- Lists
- dictionaries
- data blocks

- I think the concept of a list is easy to grasp.  Ordered stuff.
- we could go into how lists can contain different types but maybe not - students don't use it in the course
- we could work the Excel spreadsheet analogy a bit more ie:
    - a list datatype is like the rows in the spreadsheet
    - dictionary keys and values are like the columns in the spreadsheet
- but we need to go further as most data blocks will be multi-dimensional.  
    - maybe we can demonstrate that by, say, having the SACAT data block 
      displayed as a spreadsheet and show the shortcomings of the two-dimensional limit,
      and then show how we solve this in a data block.
- I think the key with dictionaries is emphasising that they're used to look up
  something in particular.  They give us this lookup ability.  We don't get
  that in lists
- talking about multidimensionality will probably be too much.
