Docassemble is an incredibly powerful tool for creating legal software applications. However, that does not always mean it is easy to use. 

We can often run into **bugs** using Docassemble. These bugs can be very frustrating to solve.

When you encounter a bug in Docassemble and you are truly stuck, sometimes the best way to help solve that bug is to ask someone for help rather than waste any more of your own time.
