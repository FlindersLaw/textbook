title: If Statements and Endpoints

With if statements, we now have a way to make decisions. That is, our app can do one thing or another depending on the input it receives. This extends beyond just displaying `True` or `False` in our output. We can direct the flow of the program depending on how the user inputs certain information. 

For example, you might want your app to perform a set of initial eligibility checks before proceeding with your main analysis. You might want to check for age or residency, because your app only applies to adults who are not pensioners or South Australian residents. These kinds of preliminary questions are good to resolve early in your processing flow. Otherwise, your user might have to run through the whole app to find out they should have never run it in the first place!

Therefore, we can ask the user a few preliminary questions and, based on those questions, decide which path the application should take. Let's take a look at the following flowchart. We are going to be using flowcharts a lot to explain how applications work:

<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_3/eligible_ineligible_flowchart.PNG' />

Let's look at this flowchart a bit more. We ask some initial eligibility questions. If these criteria are met, then we execute the rest of the program. Otherwise, we drop the user out - after explaining why, of course. 

Now, this flowchart is *technology neutral*. That means we can use any programming language to implement this flow of control. However, what we are going to do now is implement this flow of control using Docassemble.

  Welcome to our service (we don't know what it is yet). We hope you enjoy
  using it!

# This code block drives the interview. It determines whether the initial
# eligibility requirements have been met and if they are directs the user # to the 'eligible' endpoint. Otherwise, it directs the user to the 
# 'ineligible' endpoint. Each endpoint displays an exit screen
# For the purposes of this exercise, a user is eligible to continue if they
# are between 18 and 65 and are an Australian citizen.
# Note: This code block must be mandatory.

Let's talk about this program in a little more depth. We have a question block at line 6 and a code block starting at line 23. However, we are doing a few things a little differently than in previous programs.

First, we are using a lot of comments. Commenting is good practice, and helps explain to anyone else who might be reading your code how it works.

Second, the question block at line 6 does not define any variables. Instead, this question block serves as an opening screen. It explains what the application does, and also includes a Disclaimer. Depending on what your application does, you should include a disclaimer. Sometimes you might be handling personal information submitted by your user. In this case, you will need to explain to the user that you are in compliance with privacy law. Alternatively, if your app provides legal information, you will need to clearly explain that you are not providing *legal advice*. After all, that's something only lawyers can do.

Third, we have replaced the restart button with a **continue** button. The continue button tells Docassemble to move onto the next mandatory block, which in this case is the code block at line 23.

The mandatory code block tests the values of `MJFage_ok` and `MJFis_citizen`. Note the notation of the test for `MJFage_ok` here. This is the same as if we were to write `MJFage_ok == True`.
