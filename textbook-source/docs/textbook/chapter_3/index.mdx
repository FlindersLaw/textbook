Do branchig first:
- call it branching
- if statements in code blocks
- if statements in Mako
- make sure the differences between both are clear
- use flow charts first.  Flow charts show the logic flow and then show how
  the flow charts are implemented in code.
  - start with a basic if
  - then if/else
  - then if/elifs/else
  - then nested if statements

Then do iteration:
- hmm but for iteration you need lists and dictionaries, so maybe do those
  first.

Then do lists

Then do iteration
- again, use the flow charts.

Then do dictionaries
