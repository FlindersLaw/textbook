As the name implies, Docassemble allows you to assessmble documents. This section covers how to create documents.

## Limits of Markdown
You might have noticed in previous chapters that Markdown has some limits. The formatting is pretty basic and you cannot add coloured text or backgrounds. That means it is good for displaying text to a user in a web page, but not so good for assembling documents.

## Jinja
To help us assemble documents, we need to use Jinja. We have covered how to use Jinja in previous chapters.  By adding Jinja codes into a word processing document, Docassemble can then read this document and replace the Jinja codes with values our user has entered.

:::tip
Throughout this chapter, we refer to the Microsoft Word .docx format. However you can use other document formats as well (such as the LibreOffice .odt format).
:::

We can handle the other formatting, such as text effects and images, in the document. 

### Creating Our Application
What we will do in this section is create a legal application that helps the user fill in a Federal Court form. The application will do the following:

* The application will first ask the user where they are filling their application
* If they are filling their application in either the Supreme Court, the Magistrates Court or the District Court, they will be taken to an ineligible screen
* Otherwise, they will be asked to fill in the details about their application. These include the following:
    - The District Registry (state or territory) where the application is being filed 
    - The Division (that is, the matter type) of the Federal and Family Court court where the application is being filed
    - The full name of the applicant
    - The full name of the respondent
    - The date of filling
    - Who is completing the form
    - In what capacity they are acting in (Applicant, Respondent, Lawyer for the Applicant, Lawyer for the Respondent)
* The user can then download this template and file it

:::tip
If you look at the template, you might see that there are some other fields. We will work out how to complete these in the next [section](./00-20.mdx).

### Turning Our Design into a flowchart

### Controlling What Our User Can download
You might have noticed when working with Jinja previously that your user can either download a PDF or a DOCX template. In some cases though, we might not want to allow our user to download a DOCX document. In this case, we can control what content we display to our user using the `valid formats` tag. We need to add this to our code in the following format:

```yaml showLineNumbers title="Ch8_First_Docassemble_Template_PDF_Only.yml"
---
question: Please answer these details about yourself
fields: 
  - Salutation: userSalutation
    choices:
      - Dr
      - Mr
      - Mrs
      - Ms
  - First Name: userFirstName
  - Last Name: userLastName
---
mandatory: True
question: Thank you for completing this form
subquestion: |
  ### Welcome to Docassemble!

  Dear ${ userSalutation + ' ' + userLastName}, 

  Thank you for completing this form. 

  You can download an attachment with your answers below.

attachment:
  docx template file: Docassemble_Template.docx
  valid formats:
    - pdf
buttons: 
  - Exit: exit
  - Restart: restart
---
```

When our user fills in their details, they will only be able to download the completed template as a PDF:

<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_08/ch08_completed_attachment_PDF_only.PNG' altText='Our completed attachment, only now the user can only download the completed template as a PDF.'/>

## Summary and Next Steps
In this section, we have covered:

* How to create Jinja fields
* How to add an attachment block to Docassemble
* How to upload our template to Docassemble

<Quizlet title="Jinja variable syntax">
  We would like to refer to the variable `userAge` using Jinja syntax in a Microsoft Word template. How would we do this?
  <Answer>
