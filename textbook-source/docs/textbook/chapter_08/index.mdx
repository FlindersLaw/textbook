One of the most powerful features of Docassemble is the way that it allows you to create documents. These are templates which your user can fill in with content. 

In this chapter, <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_08' />, we will cover how to create Docassemble templates. We will first cover how to create Jinja fields, how to add these Jinja fields to a document and then how to upload this template to Docassemble. We will also cover how to control the output from our attachments block. 

We will then cover more advanced features of Jinja. These advanced features include using if statements, nested if statements, iteration and tables. We will also cover how to use paragraph tags in Docassemble.

Finally, we will discuss how to debug your Jinja code if something goes wrong. 

Off we go!
