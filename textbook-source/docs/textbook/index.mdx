*By Mark Ferraretto and James Scheibner*

Flinders University is unique in that it teaches coding skills, firstly, in a rather fundamental way and,
secondly, as a core part of its Law degress.  We have taken an unusual, and challenging, approach to teaching
our students legal technology skills, but we have done so for a reason.  Ultimately, we beleive that by
being exposed to coding you will gain a fundamental understanding of how legal technology works.  You
will be exposed to the challenges in expressing the law as code and also the amazing, and to date very
much untapped, potential the applying technology to legal problems has in making the law more accessible.

Along the way you will feel uncomfortable, challenged, frustrated, but ultimately you'll feel a great sense
of accomplishment and real sense of reward.  You will also gain some skills that not many law graduates have,
and that should make you a more attractive employment propsect.

In this Foreword we want to give you some background as to who we are and why we teach legal technology 
the way we do.

Before we do that though, Mark wants to tell you a story.

## Mark's Story
Those of you that go to the effort to stalk me (Mark!) on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mark-ferraretto) or check out my [staff page](https://flinders.edu.au/people/mark.ferraretto) will see that, firstly, I have an extensive background in IT and, more importantly, I came to the law as a mature-age student.
I was 46 years old when I started out as a clerk and then a junior solicitor at my first firm.  My junior peers were literally half my age (yes, a few were 23!) and, supposedly, members of the technological generation.

At this first job I quickly came to realise that the technology being used by the firm was quite ill-suited to the firm's needs.  For example, many of the firm's senior lawyers travelled, but the firm's systems did not allow them to access their files on their phones.
My fellow, supposedly tech-savvy, junior peers had no idea as to how unsuited the technology was and gradually settled into the same inefficiencies the senior staff already accepted (45 minutes to open a new matter? No problem!).

This sat in stark contrast to my experience as an IT graduate some 30 years prior, where employers lookd
to graduates to bring new ideas into their businesses.  IT grads were 'influencers' of sorts.
I wanted law graduates to be the same.  

I want to equip you with enough knowledge about technology that you can walk into a firm, think differently and make a difference.  Every university makes law graduates who know the law.  I want to make your employment
prospects more than just a GPA fight with other graduates.  I want to provide you with a unique set of skills,
skills only Flinders students have, skills that are genuinely useful to your employers, so that from day one
you can make a difference in your form.

Doing so makes you more valuable as a graduate.  It sets you apart from other graduates in the market and makes you more employable.

## Exposure to Technology
*Or, 'Why do I have to learn how to code? I'm not going to be a programmer!'*

First, I should say that it is *not* our intention to turn you into programmers.  That's an entire degree on its own.  What we do want to do is to expose you to coding so that you understand how technology works.  You'll also
find that even with the little we do teach you (compared to an IT degree) you'll still gain useful skills.  
You will be able to write basic legal apps for example.

So, why teach coding if we're not making developers out of you?

### A Better Understanding of Technology
Coding is the technology that underpins *all* technology.  The basic concepts that you learn in the topic, such as branching, iteration and data storage, underpin all the technology that you use.
By getting a grasp of these fundamentals you get an understanding of how any technology works.
Consequently, this should make you more confident learning, understanding and adapting to new and existing technologies as they cross your path during your career, such as practice management systems, business 
intelligence systems, contract management systems and so-on.

### Synergies Between Technology and Law
In my experience as an IT professional migrating to law I was surprised at the synergies that exist between the two disciplines. In IT I also had to break down a problem into its elements.  I also had to deal with each 
element separately and structure my response in a particular way and I also had to then bring my analysis
together into a final 'conclusion', being the code's output.  I also had a lot of leeway as to how I expressed
what I wrote and what my output was.  I could be creative, I could write elegant code or not-so-elegant code.

I was surprised to see how similar law was in its requirements for me also to combine method, structure and
creativity.

Coding is not as remote as you might think!  Sure, it's a different mode of expression (see more on that)
below, but you can bring your existing legal skills to bear and apply them to a quite different discipline.

### Attention to Detail
Where coding differs from written expression is that it imposes on you a requirement for attention to detail.
Miss a space, or an indent, or a semicolon and your code won't work. Unlike legal writing,
coding *requires* structure and does not forgive spelling or grammatical errors.
Coding forces you to analyse a problem in a logical way and to express it precisely.

This is not bad thing though.  You'll learn to pay more attention to detai, and 
this will help you in your legal career.

## Enabling Access to Justice
When we think access to justice what usually comes to mind is working at a clinic or pro bono or other volunteer work.  These are the usual contexts in which access to justice is discussed.
However, technology has a real potential to improve access to justice, particularly the *access* part
of access to justice.

Technology is a great enabler in making information more accessible.  For example, making a paper
directory available [online](https://docassemble.flinders.edu.au/interview?i=docassemble.LLAW33012020S1P02:data/questions/main_code2.yml#page1) and so making accessible at any time and also to rural and regional 
clients, or providing tenants facing eviction with a quick and easy [directory](https://docassemble.flinders.edu.au/interview?i=docassemble.SACATHomelessnessAdvisor:data/questions/SHA_main.yml#page1)
of emergency accommodation providers, or providing information on
[dring driving offences](https://docassemble.flinders.edu.au/interview?i=docassemble.LLAW33012023S1LSC1:data/questions/LSC1_S1_Main.yml#page1).

Technology can also increase efficiency through automation. For example, a law firm can streamline their
[new client intake process](https://docassemble.flinders.edu.au/interview?i=docassemble.LLAW33012023S1MSM1:data/questions/MSM1main.yml#page1), making client interviews shorter and saving money for their clients.
Or, an NDIS provider can provide a [self-help tool](https://docassemble.flinders.edu.au/interview?i=docassemble.LLAW33012020S1P18:data/questions/GP18FINAL.yml#page1) for its clients navigating the NDIS, saving their clients
time and money but also freeing up not-for-profit staff for other tasks.

As you may be aware, the legal profession is very much a paper-based profession.  There is a great deal of 
potential to leverage technology to replace some of this paper with more efficient online processes or
to provide accessible information to assist the general public to navigate the justice system.

## Employability
Law is an experience-based profession.  The more you practice the better you get at practising (usually!).
Law firms must usually invest a substantial amount of effort into graduates over a few years before they see a return on that investment.

However, graduates who are comfortable with technology bring added value into a firm from the time they're employed.  This is a more attractive proposition for a legal employer.

Most firms are not technology-literate.  Consequently, even a basic exposure to technology,
can be a significant asset to a firm that is trying to adopt to 21st century best-practice but doesn't know how.  

The skills you learn with us set you apart from graduates from other universities.
The skills you learn are of immediate use to many firms.  It's a differentiator.  It sets you apart from other graduates and makes you a more attractive prospect as a graduate.

## Conclusion
There is no doubt that this learning coding is challenging.  To call it different to your other studies
 is an understatement!  However, it can also be very rewarding.

There is a special sense of achievement that comes from putting a software app together and having it run successfully.  It is even more special to hand your applicaiton over to a grateful, and often excited,
client and see it used in their organisation, as some of you may get the opportunity to do.

Embrace the challenge and you will reap the rewards.

## What are we doing?

Now it is my turn to introduce you to the topic!
As you first enrol in this topic and look at the assessments, you are probably asking yourself why we teach you how to code. You might be left thinking that this topic is about teaching you how to become software developers. However, what this topic is really about is getting you to think about **access to justice** differently. 

What do we mean by access to justice? In the Australian legal system, everyone has the right to access justice. In other topics in your law degree, you will learn about how to construct an argument for your client before a court. However, just because everyone has the right to access justice does not mean that this right is easy to exercise in practice. In 2018, the Law Council of Australia conducted a [review](https://www.lawcouncil.asn.au/justice-project/final-report) of the social and economic barriers limiting access to justice. The Law Council's report notes that disadvantage can be a trigger for legal problems, with people experiencing multiple layers of disavantage more likely to experience complex legal problems. In addition, financial disadvantage and poverty can be a significant barrier to accessing a lawyer. In Australia, legal aid grants are available to people who cannot otherwise afford lawyers. However, only eight perecent of the Australian population can access legal aid, despite the fact that forteen percent of Australians live below the poverty line. Likewise, government funded community legal centres play a key role in helping provide free legal advice to the community. Unfortunately because these community legal centres have limited resources, it is estimated that at least [170,000 Australians](http://classic.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/PrecedentAULA/2019/53.html#fn2) are turned away from free legal services every year. 

To help overcome these barriers, the Law Council's report [recommended](https://lawcouncil.au/files/web-pdf/Justice%20Project/Final%20Report/03%20-%202018%2009%20-%20Recommendations%20and%20Group%20Priorities.pdf) exploring the potential benefits that technology can bring. It is important to recognise that technology is not going to immediately solve the access to justice gap in Australia. The Law Council's report warns that certain disadvantaged groups who are digitally excluded and could be left behind without due care. However, the Law Council's report also highlights how online self-help tools can provide individuals with sufficient capacity to resolve their own issues. Many of the applications that our students have developed for this course can make a difference right away in helping people solve their legal problems. Legal technology can also help refer people to the most appropriate service to help solve their problems, as well as help people fill out forms. All of these applications can make a real difference to help people access justice, 24/7. Also, by completing this topic you get an insight into real socio-legal issues that few other law topics give you.

## Why do we teach you coding?

We do not expect you to leave this topic as a software engineer (unless you want to retrain as a software engineer). However, if you understand the basic coding concepts you learn during this topic you'll be able to apply them to almost any technology. My introduction to legal informatics involved learning to code precedents, or automated documents, using a practice management platform at a law firm. For example, you might use a precedent to automatically generate a contract for the sale of a client's business. 

Unfortunately, very few lawyers or paralegals have the time to learn how to code and then actually code these precedents. However, the code that we teach you in this topic is very similar to the code that you might use for a precedent. Therefore, by completing this topic you will have an immediate advantage relative to your peers. In addition, we teach you how to use word processing software and productivity suites, such as Microsoft Office 365. Although you might be very familiar with these tools from your other topics, they have some powerful features which can help you when preparing legal documents.
