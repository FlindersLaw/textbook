## Welcome!
Welcome to *LLAW3301: Law in a Digital Age*  I'm sure you've heard a lot about this topic. It's a very unusual topic as law topics go.  Yes, it is challenging but we find that students also find it very rewarding.  I sincerely hope you do so as well.

I would like to outline for you the rationale behind teaching what we teach in this topic. I hope it gives you a better understanding of why we teach what we teach and what we hope you can take away from your experience.

Before I do that though, let me tell you a story.

### My Story
Those of you that go to the effort to stalk me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/mark-ferraretto) or check out my [staff page](https://flinders.edu.au/people/mark.ferraretto) will see that, firstly, I have an extensive background in IT and, more importantly, I came to the law as a mature-age student.  
I was 46 years old when I started out as a clerk and then a junior solicitor at my first firm.  My junior peers were literally half my age (yes, a few were 23!) and, supposedly, members of the technological generation.

At this first job I quickly came to realise that the technology being used by the firm was quite ill-suited to the firm's needs.  For example, many of the firm's senior lawyers travelled but the firm's systems did not allow them to access their files on their phones.
My fellow, supposedly tech-savvy junior peers had no idea as to how unsuited the technology was and gradually settled into the same inefficiencies the senior staff already accepted (45 minutes to open a new matter? No problem!).

This sat in stark contrast to my experience as an IT graduate 30 years prior, where graduates were looked at to bring new ideas to their employers.  IT grads were 'influencers' of sorts.
I wanted law graduates to be the same.  

I want to equip you with enough knowledge about technology that you can walk into a firm, think differently and make a difference.
Doing so makes you more valuable as a graduate.  It sets you apart from other graduates in the market and makes you more employable.

Hence this topic and why this topic is designed how it is.  Let's talk about that a bit more.

## Aims of the Topic

In short, the topic has these three aims:

1. to expose you to technology in a fundamental way that gives you a broad understanding of how tech works;
1. to demonstrate how technology can be a significant enabler of access to justice; and
1. consequently, make you more employable law graduates.

Let's discuss each of these in turn.

## Exposure to Technology
*Or, 'Why do we have to learn coding? I'm not going to be a programmer!'*

First, I should say that it is *not* our intention to turn you into programmers.  That's an entire degree on its own.  Having said that, we *do* teach you coding but our purpose is not to turn you into software developers.

We are not the only university that teaches legal technology but we are one of a very few globally that 'real' coding skills.  Why is that? There are a number of reasons. 

### A Better Understanding of Technology
Coding is the technology that underpins *all* technology.  The basic concepts that you learn in the topic, such as branching, iteration and data storage, underpin all the technology that you use.
By getting a grasp of these fundamentals you get an understanding of how any technology works and consequently should make you more confident learning, understanding and adapting to new and existing technologies as they cross your path during your career.

### Synergies Between Technology and Law
In my experience as an IT professional migrating to law I was surprised at the synergies that exist between the two disciplines.
Both are technical processes and both involve a mixture of method, structure and creativity.  The presents to you an opportunity to leverage the skills you learn in your other topics across an entirely different discipline.

### Attention to Detail
Coding also imposes on you a greater discipline and attention to detail, which will help you in your legal career.
Unlike legal writing, coding *requires* structure and does not forgive spelling or grammatical errors.
Coding forces you to analyse a problem in a logical way and to express it precisely.
You will find all these skills very useful in your legal career.

## Enabling Access to Justice
When we think access to justice what usually comes to mind is working at a clinic or pro bono or other volunteer work.  These are the usual contexts in which access to justice is discussed.
However, technology has a real potential to improve access to justice and this topic does so in a very unique way.

As you may know, in this topic we engage with not-for-profit organisations who ask us to solve real-world problems for them.  You may also be aware that some organisations have gone on to either [use](https://docassemble2.flinders.edu.au/interview?i=docassemble.LLAW33012020S1P12%3Adata%2Fquestions%2FHSC_NDISmain.yml#page1) or [adapt](https://forms.sa.gov.au/#/form/609b4ec5ad9c5a1fa0c424b4) apps written by students for use inside their organisations.
This shows the real potential of technology in access to justice.  The apps written in the topic are reasonably simple and yet they are not written 'out in the world'.
This is most likely because of the cost of having to engage commercial developers and issues with ongoing support of the applications.
This presents a real opportunity for topics such as ours to write simple applications that can have a significant impact on access to justice that would otherwise not be written.

This is a novel way of addressing the access to justice issue.

### Examples
Here are some examples

One of our 'clients' provides employment services to people with intellectual disabilities.
Given their clientele they aldo find themselves also fielding questions about the Disability Support Pension (DSP) and queries around the NDIS.  This is not their 'core business' and takes time for staff to handle queries, research an answer and respond to the client.
Two student groups worked with this client to produce an app that provided assessment information about the DSP and also some assistance with the NDIS.  As a result, the agency's staff were freed up to focus on their core business and their clients are now able to get the access to the information they need.

Another agency supported tenants who receive a 'vacant possession order'.  This order usually means a tenant has to vacate their home in seven days.
This agency wanted to find a way to support its clients in finding emergency accommodation.  Again, this was not their core business.
A student group wrote an app which asked users information such as their age, gender, where they lived and so-on and then prepared for the user a list of emergency accommodation providers suitable for their needs.  It reduced a very stressful process to simply working down a list top-to-bottom ringing agencies.

All three of these applications enable access to justice in a very simple but extremely effective way.

## Employability
I've touched on this in [my story](#my-story) above.

Law is an experience-based profession.  The more you practice the better you get at practising (usually!).
Law firms must usually invest a substantial amount of effort into graduates over a few years before they see a return on that investment.
Digital Age graduates, however, bring some added value into a firm from the time they're employed.
Most firms are not technology-literate.  Consequently, even a basic exposure to technology, as you learn in this topic, can be a significant asset to a firm that is trying to adopt to 21st century best-practice but doesn't know how.  

The skills you learn in *Digital Age* set you apart from graduates from other universities.
The skills you learn, meaning the exposure to and understanding of technology that you gain, in the topic, are of immediate use to many firms.  It's a differentiator.  It sets you apart from other graduates and makes you a more attractive prospect as a graduate.

## Conclusion
There is no doubt that this topic is challenging.
To call it different to your other topics is an understatement! 
However, it can also be very rewarding.
There is a special sense of achievement that comes from putting a software app together and having it run successfully.
It is even more special to hand your applicaiton over to a grateful, and often excited, client and see it used in their organisation.

Embrace the challenge and you will reap the rewards.
