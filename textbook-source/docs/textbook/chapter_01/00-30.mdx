## What is Docassemble?
Docassemble is what's known as an [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source)
[web framwork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_framework) written for the purposes or writing
legal apps.  Docassemble was written by [Jonathan Pyle](https://www.lawnext.com/2022/04/lawnext-podcast-jonathan-pyle-on-why-he-developed-docassemble-and-made-it-open-source.html)
a US lawyer and software developer working in the not-for-profit legal space.

Docassemble's main purpose is to create automated interviews to guide users through
legal issues and then present a result or answers back to the user.

Because it is open source there is no requirement to pay licence fees for its use. Apart
from the obvious benefit to the University, this also makes Docassemble accessible to
not-for-profit organisations and allows them to develop and run small legal apps to
help their organisations.

### Technologies used in Docassemble
Docassemble uses a language called [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) to structure
its programs, or **Interviews**.

Interviews are primarily composed of <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='questionblock' plural />
and <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='codeblock' plural />, although there are many other
block types which can be used.  

Question blocks are used to display questions to, and collect answers from, the end user.
Question blocks are also used as display screens.  For example, an initial screen welcoming
the user to the app and expalining its purpose will be rendered using a question block.

Code blocks are the logic engine of Docassemble. Code blocks are written in a programming
language called [Python](https://python.org).  Python is one of the
[most popular languages](https://www.statista.com/statistics/793628/worldwide-developer-survey-most-used-languages/),
is an excellent general purpose language and happens to be relatively easy to
teach and to learn.

Python also has a very large presence in data science and artificial intelligence.
Many data scientists create their learning models using python code.

As Docassemble is used to create web apps, it uses [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML)
Cascading Style Sheets (or [**CSS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)) to lay out
and style its apps.  These are also industry-standard technolgies that are pervasive
across the internet.

As HTML can be cumbersome to write, especially for simple text formatting, Docassemble
also makes use of [Markdown}(https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).  Markdown
allows us to format text in a less cluttered and easier-to-read manner than HTML.

For example, a bullet list in markdown would be input as follows:
```markdown
Bullet list:

* item 1
* item 2
* item 3
```
whereas, in HTML the same list would need to be input as follows:
```html
Bullet list:
<ul>
    <li>item 1</li>
    <li>item 2</li>
    <li>item 3</li>
</ul>
```

### Docassemble's capabilities
Because Docassemble is based on YAML, Python, HTML and CSS, it enables us to create web apps
very quickly. By making use of the [bootstrap](https://bootstrap.com) theme engine Doccassemble
automatically resizes webapps for phones, tablets and computers.  This frees us up to focus
only on creating the legal app itself without having to worry about how it will appear
on different devices.

Docassemble is able to create Word or PDF documents as part of its output.  For example,
a legal app that prepares a set answers to a user's queries could also prepare those 
answers as a PDF for a user to download or email.  Alternatively, Docassemble could be
used to assist a user to fill out a form and then make the form available for download
as a Word document.

Because Docassemble uses Python as its logic engine it is possible to code almost any
decision-makinng logic, regardless of how complex it may be.

Docassemble also has a great number of other features, such as real-time two-way interviews,
connecting to AI and other systems and accessing data in databases.  We will not explore these
features in this textbook, but it is worth knowing that we are teaching you the first
steps to using a very powerful system that could be, and [already is](https://clerq.au), used in
[legal practice.

That said, let's dive into what Docassemble looks like.

## The Main Screen
Let's log in to Docassemble again.  Go to the <Components.DisplayConstants data={dahref} />.  You should end up at this screen.

<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_01/docassemble_after_signin_screen_annotated.png' />

Let's discuss this screen:

1. The black bar across the top is called the <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='navbar' upper />.
It exists at the top of every screen and contains menu bars and other information.
1. This is the **Interview Title** or **App Title**.
When you write your app you'll put its name, and maybe your client's logo in this space.
1. In this book we'll be calling this the **Drop-down menu**, or just the **menu**.
We use this menu to navigate around Docassemble.
1. Without wishing to state the obvious, this is the main body of the app.
When you're writing this area will display the [Playground](#the-playground), which we will now discuss.

## The Playground
Docassemble's 'Playground' is where we'll spend most of this topic.  The Playground is where you will edit,
test, debug and run your code.  Let's explore it.

Select *Playground* from the down menu.  You'll be taken to a screen that looks like this:

<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_01/docassemble_main_screen1.png' />

Let's break this screen into its parts:

1. This is the **Navbar**.  Its claim to fame is the *Playground* menu in the top left
which we can use to create 'Projects'.
2. This is where you manage your files and folders and where you can search for text in a file.
We won't be using the *Wizard* or *Upload* buttons in this topic.
3. This is the text editor. It's where you'll be writing your code.
4. These buttons allow you save and run your code.
5. This panel contains the <Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='variable' plural /> you
use in your code.  We will discuss variables in detail later in <Components.DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_03' />.
6. The lower part of the Playground contains a Docassemble quick reference.

Let's work through these in a bit more detail.

### 1. Navbar and *Playground* Menu
The Playground is where we will develop our apps.  Everything we need for our app, such as
code files, Word templates, images and so-on are kept in our Playground.  In short, an
app consists of many different files.

As you work on more and more projects you'll find that the Plaground can become quite cluttered
and looking for files becomes difficult.  Thankfully, Docassemble allows us to create different
'Projects' in our Playground to help keep us organised.  This is done through the *Playground*
menu on the top-left.  Click on that menu to create multiple projects.

:::tip
Check out [Switching Projects](https://docassemble.org/docs/playground.html#projects) in the 
Docassemble manual for more information on creating projects in the Playground
:::

### 2. Manging Files and folders
This area allows us to create, manage and organise our files.  The Search bar allows us to search for text
in the current file.

#### Adding a file
1. Click on *Add*
2. Enter the name of your file.
:::note
Your file name should not contain any spaces and it should always end with a `.yml`.
(eg: use `Assessment_C4.yml` instead of `Assessment C4.yml` or `Assessment C4`)
:::
3. Enter something in the main text window
4. Press <Components.DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_save_prop} />

#### Folders
We only have five folders.  We cannot, and do not need to, create any more.

<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_01/docassemble_main_screen2.png' />

Each folder serves a special purpose:
* **Packages** - contains information about the software you create.  It allows you to bundle
all the different files that make up your app into a single package for distribution.
* **Templates** - is where we will store Word files that we can use to generate forms and
document templates.
* **Static files** - is where we will store images, like company logos, that we want to make 
a part of our app.
* **Sources** - is where we can store other files relevant to our app.  We won't be using this
folder in this textbook.
* **Modules** - is where we can store custom Python programs, or 'modules' to use in our app.
We won't be using this folder in this textbook.

:::tip
The Docassemble manual has more detailed explanations about the [Packages](https://docassemble.org/docs/playground.html#packages),
[Templates](https://docassemble.org/docs/playground.html#templates) and the
[Static files](https://docassemble.org/docs/playground.html#static) folders.

### 3. Text Editor
The text editor is where you will write your code.  The numbers down the side are line numbers.  Line numbers
are very useful when trying to pinpoint code that isn't working properly.

You can see that the code you write changes colour as you write it.  This is called *syntax highlighting*. 
Syntax highlighting is useful because it visually distinguishes different parts of code by applying colors
to different elements of your code. This helps coders to quickly identify errors,
and understand the structure of their code, leading to faster and more accurate coding.

### 4. Buttons
The <Components.DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_save_prop} />
and <Components.DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_save_and_run_prop} /> buttons
do what you would expect, as do
the <Components.DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_download_prop} />
 and <Components.DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_delete_prop} /> buttons.

The *Share* button will give you a link to a running version of the current file in the Playground.  This is 
a useful way to share an application you're working on with a client or your team.

### 5. Variables
<Components.DisplayGlossaryItem item='variable' plural upper /> are
a way of storing data, such as the answers to questions, in our programs.
We discuss variables in detail in <Components.DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_03' />.

This panel contains a list of the variables used in your program.  It is a useful debugging tool because:

* variables properly defined appear in <Components.Highlight color={Constants.da_declared_variable}>blue</Components.Highlight>
* variables that are not used appear in <Components.Highlight color={Constants.da_unused_variable}>orange</Components.Highlight>;
* variables that Docassemble expects to find but can't (ie: 'undefined variables') appear in <Components.Highlight color={Constants.da_undeclared_variable}>dark red</Components.Highlight>.

If you see a sea of blue in this panel it's a good sign that your program will run.

### 6. Quick Reference
The bottom half of the screen contains a quick reference to Docassemble.  The reference is quite extensive
and, usefully, contains example code and a preview of what the code looks like when run.  The screen below
shows the different way to use Markdown to format text and images in your code.
