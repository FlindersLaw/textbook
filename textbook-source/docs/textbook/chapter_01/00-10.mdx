import * as Components from '@site/src/components';
import {DisplayConstants, DisplayImage} from '@site/src/components';
import {dahref, daorghref} from '@site/src/components';

We use <Components.DisplayConstants data={daorghref} /> as our teaching platform. To work
through this textbook you will need access to the Flinders University <Components.DisplayConstants data={dahref} />.
Let's work through getting access.

1. Your account has been created for you already.  The account login is your Flinders email ie: *your_FAN*@flinders.edu.au (**not** *firstname.lastname*@flinders.edu.au).
1. Go to the <DisplayConstants data={dahref} text='Flinders University Docassemble Server' /> and you'll be presented with a login page that looks like this:
<DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/chapter_01/docassemble_home_page.png' />
1. Click on **Sign in to save answers**.  You'll be presented with a login screen:
<DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/chapter_01/docassemble_login_screen.png' />
1. Click on **Forgot your password?** Then enter your Flinders email:
<DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/chapter_01/docassemble_forgot_password_mailer.png' />
1. Click on **Send reset password email**.  You'll be sent an email with a link to reset your password.  It should look something like this:
  <DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/chapter_01/password_reset_email.png' />

  :::caution
  Check your junk/spam folder for the reset password email.
  :::
1. Click on the **Reset Password** link and you'll be taken to this screen.  Enter a new password and click on **Change Password**.  You'll be taken back to the signin screen where you can now log in.
1. You should see a screen that looks something like this
<DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/chapter_01/docassemble_after_signin_screen.png' />
