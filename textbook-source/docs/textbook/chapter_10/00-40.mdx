title: Using Hints and Helpers in Docassemble
---

In the previous two sections, we covered how to design your application and improve your questions. This section, and the next section, will cover how to implement Docassemble functionality to improve your application.

## `hint`
The `hint` tag is something you put after a question field where the user can enter a value such as a string or an integer. You can also use a hint tag when your user needs to complete a multiple choice dropdown or a combobox input type.
