title: Using Hints and Help Text in Docassemble
---

import * as Components from '@site/src/components'

In the previous two sections, we covered how to design your application and improve your questions. This section, and the next section, will cover how to implement Docassemble functionality to improve your application.

## `hint` tags
The `hint` tag is something you put after a question field where the user can enter a value such as a string or an integer. You can also use a hint tag when your user needs to complete a multiple choice dropdown or a combobox input type. 

```yaml showLineNumbers title="Ch10_Magistrates_Court_Finder_Combobox.yml" showLineNumbers

question: |
  Where do you live?
fields:
  - no label: userLocation
    input type: combobox
    hint: Please select the of Adelaide where your suburb is located
    choices:
      - Western Adelaide: west
      - Northern Adelaide: north
      - North-East Adelaide: northeast
      - Adelaide CBD: cbd
      - Southern Adelaide: south
      - None of the above: none

The `hint` text appears greyed out, in the following manner:

## `help` tags for variables
The `help` tag allows you to put in additional text to provide the user with more information to help them make a decision. You can use a `help` tag with any question field.

```yaml showLineNumbers title="Ch10_Magistrates_Court_Finder_Help.yml" showLineNumbers

When you run this application, you should see a small question mark appear next to each option. 

<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_10/ch10_help_magistrates_court_finder.PNG' altText='Our magistrates court finder with the help icons displayed next to the options.'/>

Clicking on one of these icons will display the help text that we have entered.

## Help text for a question
In addition to attaching help text to a particualar field, you can also  add help text to a question block.

## `default` values
You can insert default values particular field using a `default` tag. You can use this tag both with fields where the user selects a value from a set of options, or where they enter a value.

Consider the following example. We have designed our application to help young people with disabilities who have turned 18.

```yaml showLineNumbers title="Ch10_Disability_Eligibility_App.yml"
---
# This question asks the user for their age
# With this application, we assume that our users need support as they become adults
# Therefore, we have set the age to 18.
question: What is your age?
fields: 
  - no label: userAge
    datatype: integer
    default: 18
---
# This question block asks the user whether they are an Australian resident.
# We assume that our users are Australian residents
# Therefore, we set the default datatype for this field to True
question: Do you live in Australia?
fields: 
  - no label: userIsResident
    datatype: yesnoradio
    default: True
---
# This question block asks the user whether they are an Australian citizen.
# We assume that our users are Australian citizens
# Therefore, we set the default datatype for this field to True
question: Are you an Australian citizen?
fields:
  - no label: userIsCitizen
    datatype: yesnoradio
    default: True
---
# This question block asks the user whether they have a disability.
# We will assume our user has been diagnosed
# We will set the default value to this question to True.
# If they do, it asks them who diagnosed them. 
# We will set the default value to occupational therapist.
question: Tell us about your diagnosis
fields:
  - Do you have a disability?: userIsDisabled
    datatype: yesnoradio
    default: True
  - If so, who diagnosed you?: whoDiagnosedUser
    default: Occupational Therapist
    choices:
      - Occupational Therapist
      - Psychologist
      - Psychiatrist
      - Paediatrician
      - Other
    show if: 
      variable: userIsDisabled

  - Who diagnosed you? : otherWhoDiagnosed
    show if:
      variable: whoDiagnosedUser
      is: Other
---
# This question block asks the user some more questions about their diagnosis
# We will assume that if someone is using this application, their disability will not improve
# Therefore, we will set this option in the checkboxes as the default value
---

  - no label: userDisabilityQ
    datatype: radio

## Terms and Autoterms
You might have a particular concept you use throughout your application. If you do, you can use `terms` and `autoterms` to help include a definition for that term.

Let's return to our disability support application. For someone to be eligible for disability support, they need to be:

* An Australian citizen;
* A permanent resident; or
* A special category visa holder

Therefore, we can use terms to help explain these criteria further to our user. 

:::tip
Please note that the code below is a fragment of Ch10_Disability_Eligibility_App.yml and will not run without the remaining code.
:::

```yaml title="Ch10_Disability_Eligibility_App_Terms.yml"
---
# This question block asks the user whether they are an Australian citizen.
# We assume that our users are Australian citizens
# Therefore, we set the default datatype for this field to True
question: Are you an Australian {citizen}?
fields:
  - no label: userIsCitizen
    datatype: yesnoradio
    default: True
terms:
  citizen: |
    An Australian citizen, a permanent resident or a special category visa holder
---
```

If we press the word highlighted in green, we can see our description.

<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_10/ch10_terms_example.PNG' altText='An example of how to use a terms clause in our application.'/>

We can also use `auto terms`. These are exactly the same as terms, except we do not need to put the term in our question block in curly brackets.

```yaml title="Ch10_Disability_Eligibility_App_Terms.yml"
---
# This question block asks the user whether they are an Australian citizen.
# We assume that our users are Australian citizens
# Therefore, we set the default datatype for this field to True
question: Are you an Australian citizen?
fields:
  - no label: userIsCitizen
    datatype: yesnoradio
    default: True
auto terms:
  citizen: |
    An Australian citizen, a permanent resident or a special category visa holder
---
```

:::caution
Of the two, `auto terms` can be more convenient than `terms`. However, if you are not careful you can end up creating terms inside terms. Be careful how you use them!
