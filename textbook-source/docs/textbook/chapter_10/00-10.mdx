title: Writing Legal Applications That Make Sense - An Introduction
---

This chapter is designed to help you write a legal application that makes sense. We recognise that not every law student will intuitively learn how to code. However, even if your application works, it will not be particularly useful if it does not ask appropriate questions and display appropriate output. Therefore, you can still help make a good application with appropriate content.

In this chapter we will consider:

* How to organise your application - 00-20
* How to write questions and text so that it is easy to understand - 00-30
* How to use help text and hints
* When do multimedia content - 00-40

These tips will help make your application more accessible to a wider audience
