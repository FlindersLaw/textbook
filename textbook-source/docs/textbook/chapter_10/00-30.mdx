title: Writing Questions Which Are Easy to Understand
---

import * as Components from '@site/src/components'

Historically, law schools have taught law students to write in specific legal jargon. However, when writing legal apps, we want to take the opposite approach. We want our forms to be as easy to understand as possible. 

We can do that by making sure our questions are as easy to understand as possible. Ideally, you want your application to be understood by someone who has completed Grade 8 schooling. Many different professions use this standard for measuring readability. For example, the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) in Australia recommends that researchers should write consent forms to enroll people in clinical trials at this level.

## Editing and Simplifying Questions
The key design principle to apply to your questions is the KISS principle - [Keep It Simple, Stupid](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/keep-it-simple-stupid)! We are going to go through how to apply KISS to your questions.

### Check Your Spelling and Grammar!
It sounds incredibly basic, but users will find it much easier to use an application with correct spelling and grammar. 

:::tip
Write out your question text in a word processor (such as Microsoft Word) before inserting them into Docassemble code. That makes it easier for you to identify spelling and grammatical errors.

### Use Plain Words
Those of you who are interested in mooting might have heard of Irving Younger, a US criminal defence lawyer, trial judge and professor. Professor Younger wrote the Ten Commandments of Cross Examination, which you can read (and watch) more about [here](https://www.advocacy.com.au/10-commandments-2.html). Younger's Second Commandment was to use simple words and to drop the legalse. 

Although Professor Younger focused on cross examination (which is beyond the scope of this textbook), we can apply his commandments to legal app development. 

Let's consider our application which determines whether someone is eligible to stand for election to the Australian Federal Parliament. We know that section 44 of the Constitution includes [five grounds](https://www8.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/cth/consol_act/coaca430/s44.html) on which a person may be disqualified:

> (i) If they are under any acknowledgement of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power, or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power; or
>
> (ii) Is attained of treason, or has been convicted and is under sentence, or subject to be sentence, for any offence punishable under the law of the Commonwealth; or
>
> (iii) Is an undischarged bankrupt or insolvent; or
>
> (iv) Holds any office of profit under the Crown, or any pension payable during the pleasure of the Crown out of any of the revenues of the Commonwealth; or
>
> (v) Has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth otherwise than  as a member and in common with the other members of an incorporated company consisting of more than twenty-five persons.

Although the drafters of the Constitution intended this section to be comprehensive, it is also very verbose. We can think of ways to phrase each of these prohibitions simply as a question. For example, rather than this:

> Are you under any acknowledgement of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power, or are a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power?

You might want to write this:

> Are you a citizen of a country other than Australia?

This sentence is shorter and easier to understand. 

If you are looking at ways to swap out words to make your text simpler, you can refer to this [Australian government style manual](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/writing-and-designing-content/clear-language-and-writing-style/plain-language-and-word-choice).

:::info
Psychologists and linguists have conducted [research](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282146) which shows sentences are easier to understand when they are shorter. In turn, easy to understand sentences help improve social justice outcomes.

### Use Active Rather Than Passive Voice
There are two ways of writing a sentence with a subject - active voice and passive voice. In the active voice, the subject of the sentence performs an action. 

For example, in the sentence '*the defendant* *drove* the car', the defendant is the subject of the sentence performing the action (driving). 

By contrast, in the sentence 'the car *was driven* by *the defendant*,' the defendant (the subject of the sentence) is being acted upon.  

Law schools often train lawyers to write using the passive voice, as it lends a tone of objectivity by suggesting the actor is not important. However, as we can see from this example, active sentences are easier to read and shorter than passive sentences.

These resources can help you distinguish between active and passive sentences:

### Write Using Formal Writing
We want to make our applications easy to understand as possible. We still need to use formal language in our application though. TRhat means:

* No contractions
* No informal words
* No colloquialisms or idioms

In addition to these rules, you need to remember that your questions should be fact based and not opinion based. Remember that even though the language you use needs to be simple, your application still provides legal information.

Please refer to this guide by the Flinders University Student Learning Support Service on how to use [formal language](https://students.flinders.edu.au/content/dam/student/slss/english-language/formal-and-informal-language.pdf).

### Use Writing Tools To Help Improve Your Questions
Earlier, we discussed how to write your questions in a word processor before putting them into Docassemble. You can then use spelling and grammar check tools to help improve your text. Most word processors also feature advanced writing tools you can use to help improve the readability of your text.

For our legal applications, we use the Flesch reading ease score and Flesch-Kincaid readability test. These tests uses the number of words per sentence and the length of each word as a measure of readability. The shorter the sentences and words in your text, the higher the Flesch-Kincaid score. 

:::tip
A Flesch reading ease score of 60 or higher indicates that the text would be readable at a Grade 8 level.
:::

There are two ways you can look up the readability score for your application. The first is using Docassemble. When you normally run your Docassemble application, you will see that there is a `</>` icon next to your application's title.

<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/chapter_10/ch10_docassemble_source_menu.PNG' altText='The source menu in Docassemble - you can use this to look up the execution order for your application, as well as find readability scores.'/>

If you click on this menu and scroll down to the heading **Readability of question** you will see both the Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scores for your application, as well as the readability consensus.

<Components.DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/chapter_10/ch10_readability_scores_docassemble.PNG' altText='The readability scores for our application in Docassemble.'/>

The second way is to use Microsoft Word. Copy your text into a Microsoft Word document, then go to the **Home** tab. Click on the **Editor** button, and then click on **Document Stats** on the popup window that appears. You will then see the document stats.

:::tip
In these screenshots, you can see that there is a difference between the scores produced by Docassemble and Microsoft Word. Always double check both scores before you publish your application (or submit it for assessment).
