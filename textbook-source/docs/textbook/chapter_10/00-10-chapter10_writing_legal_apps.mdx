title: Writing Legal Applications That Make Sense
---

This chapter is designed to help you write a legal application that makes sense. We recognise that not every law student will intuitively learn how to code. However, even if your application works, it will not be particularly useful if it does not ask appropriate questions and display appropriate output. Therefore, you can still help make a good application with appropriate content.

In this chapter we will consider:

* How to write questions
* How to organise your application
* How to write your endpoint screens
* How to use help text and hints
* How to use images
* How to design for people with special needs

## Useful Resources

These are resources that can help inspire your design of your legal applications.
