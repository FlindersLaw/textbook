Some assessments may require you to upload Docassemble code to FLO (Canvas) and
may instruct you to create a Docassemble [package](https://docassemble.org/docs/packages.html)
to do so.  This document explains one way to do this.

Docassemble packages are essentially a zip file containing all your code and other
information to run your app.  This document takes you the the process of creating 
that package Zip file, downloading it and testing it to make sure it works.

This document does not cover how to upload a zip to Canvas.  You upload zip files like
you would upload any file.

## Create a Project
If you haven't already done so create a Playground Project for your assessment.

Click on your Playground menu and select *Manage Projects*

<DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/Assessments/upload1.png' />

Create a Project for your assessment by:
1. clicking on Add Project
2. Entering a name for your Project; and
3. clicking <DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_save_prop} />.

<DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/Assessments/upload3.png' />

:::note
A Project name must:
* start with a letter
* contain only letters and numbers

You will get an error if you try to enter a project name with
spaces or dashes or underscores.

## Add your assessment files
After you save your project you're taken to your Playground Project and
you'll see it has no files.

<DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/Assessments/upload5.png' caption='Empty Playground :-(' />

Now create your assessment files.  If you already had your assessment files somewhere
else you'll need to copy and paste your existing files into files in this project.

## Create a Package for export
Go to Folders -> Packages

<DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/Assessments/upload7.png' />

### Set Package metadata
* Give your package a name
* Check the other information fields are correct.

<DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/Assessments/upload8.png' />

:::note
Your Assessment Instructions should tell you:
1. how to name your package; and
2. which other fields must be checked and set.
:::

### Add files to your package
:::caution WARNING
**You must complete this step otherwise your pacakage export will be empty!!**

Just because you have code in your Playground it does not mean that code will
automatically be added to your Packages.  Packages and Playgrounds are two separate
and unrelated things in Docassemble.

You **must explicity** add **all** your assessment files to your package
:::

Scroll down until you see the different file selector dialogs.

Check each of the *Interview files*, *Template files*, *Static files* and *Modules* for
files to add to your package.

You can click, control-click and shift-click to select the files you need.  In the example
below only the Interview files `main.yml`, `questions.yml` and `screens.yml` are being
added to this package.  Your file names and number of files may vary from assessment to assessment.

<DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/Assessments/upload9.png' />

:::note
#### Interview files
This is where the `.yml` files you create in your Playground are listed.

#### Template files
This is where any attachment templates (eg files used for `docx template file`) are listed.

#### Static files
This is where any CSS files and image files are listed

#### Source files
This is not usually used in the topics taught using this textbook

#### Modules
This is not usually used in the topics taught in this textbook but it is where custom
python modules are listed.
:::

### Save and download your package
Scroll down to the bottom of the screen.  Press <DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_save_prop} />
and then press <DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_download_prop} />.  A zip file will be saved
to your computer.

**This zip file is the file you must upload to FLO.**

## Test your Package
You can test your exported Package before you submit it.  Do the following:

1. Create another empty Playground project
1. Go to Folders -> Packages in your new Project
1. Select **Upload**
<DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/Assessments/upload10.png' />
1. Upload your zip file
1. In the package window you should see your package information
<DisplayImage imageURL='/textbook/img/textbook/Assessments/upload11.png' />
1. Click on the `<Back` button at the top left of the Navbar to go back to your Playground
1. Check all your files
1. Run your app and make sure it works.

If your upload hasn't worked then it means that your Package was not created properly.  Run through
the Package creation process described above again and follow the steps carefully.
