:::note some things to be aware of
This is **one way** of implementing the solution.  It is not necessarily **the way**.
Many of you will find that the way I have written this code differs from yours.
Some of you will find the way I have written differs from how James and I guided you during consults.
**This is not a problem** and it certainly doesn't affect your marks. I've tried to write
a solution that is reasonably efficient and also ready for B2 and B3.  In fact, I had already written
B3 and this example is a stripped down version of my B3 example.

Here are some things I may have done differnently to you:
* I didn't use eight exit screens (despite advising some of you to do so).
I chose to use templates instead.  This is because, firstly it's less typing, and 
secondly, B2/3 will require templates.
* I have **seven** templates, not eight. There are eight exit points but I've reused the same template for both the RPL and the PPL answers as they were so similar.
* To assist me with doing this I created a second code block at the end of `templates.yml` to set variables
to the relevant values depending on which licence the template was being used for.
* My screens are pretty long.  I've included a reasonably detailed analysis of the law in my screens.
I wasn't expecting students to go to this level of detail necessarily. I've done so in order that you
can see the analysis I undertook to answer each question.  This is especially relevant for the RPL
and PPL charging questions.
* Despite the screens' length, the writing style is targeted towards pilots. It's reasonably plain English, the answer is at the top of each screen where possible.
* I had more text in my question blocks than most students. I do this to give my user/pilot more context
as they navigate through the app.
* I use the template subject as the title of `final_screen`. We will cover this in Coding Workshop 4.

Just because you didn't write code like I wrote does *not* mean you lost marks.  I marked you against
the Assessment B1 Rubric and not against this example code.
