:::note some things to be aware of
This is **one way** of implementing the solution.  It is not necessarily **the way**.
Many of you will find that the way I have written this code differs from yours.
Some of you will find the way I have written differs from how James and I guided you during consults.
**This is not a problem** and it certainly doesn't affect your marks. I've tried to write
a solution that is reasonably efficient and also ready for B3.

Just because you didn't write code like I wrote does *not* mean you lost marks.  I marked you against
the Assessment B2 Rubric and not against this example code.

#### Assessment B3
You are welcome to copy this code and use it as a base for Assessment B2.
