Through most of this textbook you will encounter code that is contained within a single file,
for example, our [Vital Statistics](/docs/textbook/chapter_02/00-60) app.  As we develop more
and more sophisticated apps we write more and more lines of code.  As we write more code
the need to organise the code we write becomes more and more necessary, so that we can
reduce the amount of time we spend looking for the code.

## Code in multiple files
It is well within your capabilities, after working through this textbook, to write reasonably
sophisticated apps consisting of many hundreds or even thousands of lines of code.
Storing all your code in a single file becomes impractical when we approach these kinds of numbers.
That's because, firstly, it simply becomes too hard to find the code we want to work on and, secondly,
we can also run up against computer system limitations for displaying large files.

The solution to this issue is to split out your code into multiple files and then incorporate them
all together some how.  The 'some how' in Docassemble is achieved by way of an
[`include`](https://docassemble.org/docs/initial.html#include) block. 

The [Docassemble manual](https://docassemble.org/docs/initial.html#include) discusses what
`include` blocks are and how they work.  In this part of the textbook we want to talk more
about how best to use them and to suggest a way to organise your code.

## Use `main.yml`
Firstly, as soon as we start breaking up our code into multiple files, it follows that we need to
nominate one of these files to load and run our app. By convention in programming this file
is referred to as the 'main file'. Also by convention it should be named `main.yml` or something
that contains the word `main` in it.  Our recommendation is that you use `main.yml` as the name
of your main file.

## What should be in `main.yml`
Now that we have a main file the next question is what it should contain.  In principle 
the main file should contain [only the code that drives the application overall](minimising_mandatory_blocks).  This
should consist of any <DisplayGlossaryItem item='mandatoryblock' plural />, final screens
and any other blocks required to set up the app, such as [`metadata`](https://docassemble.org/docs/initial.html#metadata)
and [`features`](https://docassemble.org/docs/initial.html#features) blocks.  We should also
have an `include` block to incorporate our other program files into our app.

Here is an example of what a `main.yml` might look like:
```yml showLineNumbers
---
include:
  - questions.yml
  - database.yml
  - code_logic.yml
---
features:
  css: styles.css
---
mandatory: True
question: Welcome screen
subquestion: |
  This is the welcome screen
buttons:
  - Continue: continue
  - Exit: exit
---
mandatory: True
code: |
  # Code that drives the app goes here

  # Then call the final screen
---
event: final_screen
question: Final Screen
subquestion: |
  Text for final screen goes here
buttons:
  - Restart: restart
  - Exit: exit
---
```

### Lines 2 to 5
This is our `include` block.  It tells Docassmble to make `questions.yml`, `database.yml` and
`code_logic.yml` part of our app.

### Lines 7 and 8
This is a `features` block that directs the app to load the styles in `styles.css` into our
app.

:::note
Styles and basic app design is covered in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_07' />.
:::

### Lines 10 to 30
This is the recommended structure for the logic of `main.yml`.  That is, the first screen
of the app is a <DisplayGlossaryItem item='mandatoryblock' />, followed by a mandatory
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='codeblock' /> and then a final screen.  This architecture is
discussed in more detail [here](minimising_mandatory_blocks).

:::note
If your app had many different final screens you would want to separate them out 
into another file instead of including them in your `main.yml`.

## Organising your files
There are no set rules for organising your code into files.  In short, you need to find
what works best for you.  Having said that here are some suggestions you may want to
consider.

### Organise by function
This method is alluded to in the [example above](#what-should-be-in-mainyml).  Question
blocks get put into one file, code blocks into another file and databases into another file.

If nothing else, this is a good place to start.  If you're not sure how to organise your app
then at least start breaking out your code by function.  Any organisation is better than no
organisation at all. Often as you develop your app you may find a more suitable organisational
scheme.  It's not too much effort to move away from this function-based scheme to any other
scheme.

### Organise by role
This is suitable for larger apps.  For example, you may group all your code that deals with,
say, legal analysis into one file (or set of files), and code that deals with presentation 
of information to the user in another file and so-on.  

Neither role is necessarily better than the other, although this author usually starts out
organising by function and building from there.

Students that have work assessed may find that organising your code into multiple files
may form part of your assessment criteria.

## Examples
Here are some examples of applications using multiple files and `include` blocks.  They
also demonstrate the principle of keeping as little information possible in `main.yml`.

<DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_06' /> contains case studies which consider sophisticated
app examples.

<DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_07' /> discusses styling your app.  The example code produced
in this chapter also is split into multiple files and structured according to the guidelines set
out in this part of the textbook.
