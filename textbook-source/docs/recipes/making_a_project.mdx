### Making a Project
Let's create a new project and call it 'TeachingCode' (spaces aren't allowed
in project names)

Click on 'Playground' and select 'Manage Projects'
<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/github1.png' />

Click on 'Add a New Project'
<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/github2.png' />

Create a new project called `TeachingCode` and press <DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_save_prop} />
<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/github3.png' />

You should now be in your new Playground.  In the top-left of the black
navbar you will see 'Playground / TeachingCode'.

Now let's pull the code down from GitHub.  Click on the 'Folders' menu,
then click 'Packages'
<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/github4.png' />

Click 'Pull'
<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/github5.png' />

In the GitHub URL enter <DisplayConstants data={teachingcodeurl} />
<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/github6.png' />

Click on <DisplayDAButtons button={Constants.da_save_prop} button_text='Pull' />

You will be returned to the Package screen.  A banner will appear across the top
of your screen telling you the repository (or 'package') has been uploaded
and you will also notice the Package name has changed and information about
the package has been populated.
<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/github7.png' />

Click on `<Back` to go to your playground.  Click on the Folders menu and 
you will see a list of files from the package.
<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/textbook/chapter_02/github7.png' />

You now have a copy of all the code used in this textbook in your local
Playground.  That should save you a bit of typing as we move on.
