import {DisplayGlossaryItem} from '@site/src/components';

[Template blocks](https://docassemble.org/docs/initial.html#template) are a way of storing
boilerplate text that you may want to re-use in multiple places in your app.  They are
particularly useful when displaying information that has to be displayed on a screen and
in an attachment.

Templates are assigned a variable name, like any other data in Docassemble.  Templates consist of
two parts: a 'subject' and 'content'.
```yml
---
template: variable_name
subject: Subject goes here
content: |
  Content goes here
---
```
You can use <DisplayGlossaryItem item='markdown' upper /> and <DisplayGlossaryItem item='mako' upper />j
in both the `subject` and `content` parts of the template. Doing so is encouraged in the `content` as it
allows you to re-use your template and make your coding more efficient.  For example, this template 
would be displayed to tell a user whether their potential action was out of time.  It makes a
decision based on the `out_of_time` variable which would be set elsewhere in the app.
```yml
---
template: oot_template
subject: Information about Your Claim
content: |
  Based on your answers it appears that you
  %if out_of_time:
  **may not**
  %else:
  **may**
  %endif
  be able to bring an action for breach of contract against ${other_party}.
  
  According to section 35 of the *Limitations of Actions Act 1936* (SA) actions
  in contract must be brought within six years of the occurrence of the breach.
---
```
You could subsequently display this template in a final screen:
```yml
---
event: final_screen
question: Final Scren
subquestion: |
  Some other text
  ...
  
  ### ${oot_template.subject}

  ${oot_template}
---
```
In this example we format the subject as a level 3 heading and then display the template
contents underneath it.

Please refer to the [Docassemble manual](https://docassemble.org/docs/initial.html#template) for
more information about template blocks.
