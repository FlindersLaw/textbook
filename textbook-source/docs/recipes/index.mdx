This part of the textbook contains small bits and pieces about coding that don't
neatly fit into the existing chapters but are too small for chapters of their own.

:::note
For those of you unfamiliar with the term, a 'Recipe' is usually a small piece of code
the achieves a particular outcome and that can be copied and re-used in other code.

Recipes can also be examples of apps that implement certain coding features.  We will
use both these definitions.  

The Docassemble manual also contains [a set of recipes](https://docassemble.org/docs/recipes.html)
