Docassemble follows what is known as a [declarative programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming).

Most programming languages are [imperative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_programming),
that is, the programmer uses the programming language to tell the program what to do and when to do it.
In Declarative systems the 'when to do it' is left up to the system.  The programmer programs the 
'what to do' - in Docassemble's case by using blocks such as 
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='questionblock' plural /> and <DisplayGlossaryItem item='codeblock' plural />,
amongst others, but it is up to Docassemble to decide which block should be called and when.

Programming in a declarative way is meant to reduce workload on the programmer, as they no longer
need to write the 'when' code, and should make the program more efficient to run, as the system
can calculate the optimal execution logic.

## What this means for us
The declarative nature of Docassemble means we should try to direct it as little as possible.
Practically, that means we should limit the number of <DisplayGlossaryItem item='mandatoryblock' plural />
to as few as possible. You will have seen this in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_01' /> where usually
only a single mandatory block is declared, with all other blocks marked as non-mandatory.  The 
single mandatory block is the starting point and we then let Docacssemble do the rest of the work
in deciding which other (usually question) blocks to call and when.

More sophisticated examples can be seen in the case studies in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_06' />
and also the styling example worked through in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_07' />.  The apps
in both these chapters are reasonably sophisticated with many code, question and other blocks.  However,
they are driven by only two mandatory blocks: a question block to display an initial, or 'welcome' screen 
and then a <DisplayGlossaryItem item='codeblock' /> which controls the execution of the program.

This is a good model and it is one that students should aim to use in their exercises and apps
they develop.

:::note
Some [examples](/docs/textbook/chapter_07/00-30#chapter7yml) in this text do sometimes include
additional manadtory blocks but these are for ancillary purposes, such as to load fonts and
graphics.  The don't form part of the app's execution path per se.

## End screens
You may also have noticed that in the Chapter 1 code examples, the single mandatory block
is usually the final screen screen of the app.  Essentially, the app is being driven
from the final outcome and it is up to Docassemble how to get there.

This is an acceptable way for smaller programs.  However, most larger programs will require
an initial screen explaining what the app does as well as a final screen.  One option then is to
have both opening and final screens as mandatory blocks:
```yml
---
mandatory: True
question: Welcome Screen
subquestion: |
  Description of the app
buttons:
  - Continue: continue
  - Exit: exit
---
mandatory: True
question: Final Screen
subquestion: |
  Display final resuts

  Display ${variables} data. This will prompt
  Docassemble to ask questions to populate the
  variable data
buttons:
  - Restart: restart
  - Exit: exit
---
```
While this is possible, for more sophisticated applications it may be desirable
to insert some control over what Docassemble does.  For example, while Docassemble
may ask questions in the most efficient order, that order may not be logical
to the user, and a programmer may want to direct the order of questions to a degree.

Consequently, it is usually best practice *not* to make the final screen mandatory and to
use a mandatory code block to drive the app instead.

Instead, an [`event`](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#event) tag should
be used and that event variable called from the mandatory code block.  It is best
to write apps in this way even if all the mandatory code block does is call the 
final screen, as per [this example](/docs/textbook/chapter_06/filtering/00-70#mainyml).

## Example of best practice use of mandatory blocks
This is an illustration of the best practice usage for mandatory blocks.

```yml
---
mandatory: True
question: Welcome Screen
subquestion: |
  Information about app goes here
buttons:
  - Continue: continue
  - Exit: exit
---
# This code block drives the execution of the app
mandatory: True
code: |
  code_goes_here

  # Finish by calling the final screen
  final_screen
---
event: final_screen
question: Final Screen
subquestion: |
  This is the end screen.  It will contain
  data drawn from ${variables} and displayed
  as Mako.  
buttons:
  - Restart: restart
  - Exit: exit
---  
```
