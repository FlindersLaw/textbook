In this set of exercises we continue to work on if statements.  We use a more
complex example to look at how to use `if/elif/else` statements.  We also touch
on using `include` blocks and templates.

You will use all these concepts in Assessment B1.

## Pre-reading
If you haven't already done so make sure you have read through:
* <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_03' /> - Datatypes and Variables; and
* <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_04' /> - Logic and If statements

To learn about `include` blocks read through [Structuring Your Code](/docs/recipes/structuring_code)

To learn about templates read through [Template Blocks](/docs/recipes/templates)

## The Exercise
We are going to write an app that assists users in contacting the appropriate Government
body if they have experienced discrimination.

:::note
This exercise is based on the *Equal Opportunity Act 1984* (SA) (**Act** or **EOA**) as it was at 
before 31 August 2023.  Before this date the Act only allowed the 
Equal Opportunity Commission (**EOC**) to deal with discrimination relating to
age, sex, gender identity, disability and race.  This meant that discrimination 
based on other categories, such pregnancy or religious dress, could not be dealt
with the EOC and had to be dealt with by either the Australian Human Rights 
Commission (**AHRC**) at a Federal level, or by bodies such as Consumer and Business
Services or the South Australian Employment Tribunal.

On 31 August 2023 an amended version of the Act came into force.  This amended
version covers all of the categories of discrimination mentioned in our exercises.
However, so that we can learn the different coding concepts required for this 
coding workshop, we have decided to use the pre-August 2023 version of the Act.

We can represent our app in this flowchart:
