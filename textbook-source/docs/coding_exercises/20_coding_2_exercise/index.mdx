## Introduction
In this exercise you will continue working on the app you developed in
the [Coding 1 Exercise](coding_1_exercise). We will work through the steps below
and finish creating our screens and then implement decision-making logic.

## Preparation Work
* You should read <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_04' /> before attempting this exercise.
* You should be familiar with the entire chapter, but pay particular attention to if-else statements
and nested if statements.
* You should have completed working code from the Coding 1 Exercise. If you don't have completed
code you can refer to the [solution code](coding_1_exercise#this-weeks-solution-code).


## The Exercise
Last week we built out Screen 1, all the question screens and Screen 8, one of the exit screens.
This week we are going to implement the decision-making logic. As we do so we will build out
the rest of the exit screens.

### Make the rest of the exit screens
Last week we created Screen 8. Screens 3, 5 and 7 follow the same formula. Use the instructions
for Screen 8 from last week and create question blocks (with `event` tags) for screens 3, 5 and 7.

# Screen 3
event: MJFexit_screen3
question: Not Eligible
subquestion: |
  According to the *Civil Liability Act* you cannot claim for
  the services you incurred as they were not provided on a
  gratuitous basis.
buttons:
  - Exit: exit
  - Restart: restart
---
# Screen 5
event: MJFexit_screen5
question: Not Eligible
subquestion: |
  You can only be compensated if the person who provided the gratuitous services
  was your parent, spouse, domestic partner or child.
buttons:
  - Exit: exit
  - Restart: restart
---
# Screen 7
event: MJFexit_screen7
question: Not Eligible
subquestion: |
  Your claim must be limited to four times State average weekly earnings.
  State Average weekly earnings are currently $[insert current earnings].
buttons:
  - Exit: exit
  - Restart: restart
---
```
</details>

### Comparing Against State Weekly Earnings
Now we need to do some maths (!!!) According to s 58(2) a person is limited as to the amount
of damages they can claim for gratuitous services, and this limit is 'not to exceed an 
amount equivalent to 4 times State average weekly earnings'.

Consequently, we need to know, firstly, what State average weekly earnings are, and then we
need to use that figure to calculate the s 58(2) limit.

The term 'State average weekly earnings' is defined is s 3 of the Act and, so you don't have to,
I have extracted for you the current State average weekly earnings as of the date this exercise
was written.  That amount is:

**$1,776.90**

We will use this figure for this exercise.

First thing we need to do is to let our app know this amount.  We do this by setting a variable
in a code block, as follows:

```python
---
code: |
  MJFavg_earnings = 1776.9
---
```
Whenever we need to know what the average weekly earnings are we can just query this variable.

* Add this code block to the end of your code.

Next we need to calculate the s 58(2) limit. Arithmetically, this is easy, just multiply 
`MJFavg_earnings` by 4.  We can do this in another code block.

```python
---
code: |
  MJFs58_limit = MJFavg_earnings * 4
---
```
:::note notes
1. If you don't know what the `*` does in the code block above, please check out 'Data Types' in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_03'/>.
1. If you don't know what `<=` means you should also consult Chapter 3. We'll be using these symbols shortly.
1. We could have put both these statements into a single code block and saved ourselves some typing.
However, it's good practice to separate out logically different components into their own blocks.
1. `MJFavg_earnings` is set to `1776.9` and not `1776.90` or `$1776.90`. This is for two reasons.
    * Firstly, Python doesn't care whether a number represents money or anything else - it's just a number.  You will remember that we had to use the `currency()` functions in our Coding 1 Preparation exercises.
    * Secondly, as `MJFavg_earnings` is just a number, the trailing `0` is redundant.
:::

OK. Now we're ready to start making decisions!

### Decision-making with code
When implementing decisions in code, everything is reduced to a true/false proposition. We usually
re-phrase questions so that the answer is true or false. For example, the question 'Were the
service provided gratuitous' is expressed as the statement 'The services provided were gratuitous'.
If this statement is true, then one path is taken. If this statement is false, then another path is 
taken.

Sometimes not all questions have a yes or no answer. For example, the question 'Who provided the
gratuitous services?' has more than just a yes/no answer. The possible answers, according to our
flowchart, are 'Parent', 'Spouse', 'Domestic Partner', 'Child' and 'Someone Else'. In this case 
we would express each potential answer as a statemend. For example 'The person who provided
gratuitous services was my parent', 'The person who provided gratuitous services was my child' 
and so-on. We could then test each one  in turn and then act depending on whether that statement
is true or not.  To do this we would use an if/elif/else statement.  For example:

```python
code: |
  if MJFwho_provided == 'Parent':
    # Move to next step
  elif MJFwho_provided == 'Spouse':
    # Move to next step
  elif MJFwho_provided == 'Domestic Partner':
    # Move to next step
  elif MJFwho_provided == 'Child':
    # Move to next step
  elif MJFwho_provided == 'Someone Else':
    # Display screen 5 as user is not eligible
---
```
Each statement resolves to true or false.

:::note
If you look at that if/elif statement closely you'll see that the same action ('move to next step')
is performed for every possibility *except* if the person providing gratuitous servicse is
'Someone Else'. Because this is the case we could re-express the statement to essentially say 'If
the person providing gratuitous services is Someone Else then we exit the app, *otherwise* we 
move to the next step'. This statement now has only two options - the person either is Someone Else
or it isn't.  That's an easier if statement to write, and we would do so like this:

```python
code: |
  if MJFwho_provided == 'Someone Else':
    # Display Screen 5 as user is not eligible
  else:
    # Move to next step
---
```
:::

### Making Multiple Decisions
Our Section 58 Calculator chart requires us to make a set of followup decisions after we make
our first decision. For example, if we decide the services were gratuitous, then we need to decide
if the person who provided those services falls within s 58. If that person does so fall then we
need to subsequently decide if the amount claimed falls within the limit.

Let's express this as follows:
* if the services are gratuitous, then
* if the person who provided them is not someone else, then
* if the amount claimed is less than the limit, then the person may be able to claim damages.

You see we need to have three `True` answers to arrive at the conclusion that the user may be
able to claim damages.

We express this sequence of positive decisions in code as follows (using the variables from the
example code in the solution)

```yml showLineNumbers
---
code: |
  if MJFis_gratuitous:
    if MJFwho_provided != 'Someone Else':
      if MJFamount_claimed <= MJFavg_earnings
        exit_screen8
---
```
You can see that each of the three if statements on lines 3 to 5 mirror the three statements we 
expressed previously.
:::note
The symbol `!=` means 'not equal to' in Python. Thus, the code on line 5 can be read as
'if `MJFwho_provided` is not equal to Someone Else'
:::

Each if statement needs to be indented under its parent so that Python only executes it if the
previous statement is true. That is, each if statement sits under its parent if statement's 
true branch.

You could copy the above code block into your mandatory code block (replacing what is already there).
If you did so, and you answered each question correctly then you would arrive at Screen 8 - the
'You May be Eligible' screen.

* Replace the contents of your mandatory code block with the nested if statements above
* Save and run your app. Enter in the correct answers.  Do you arrive at Screen 8?

### Populating the False Branches
As we already know, each if statement evaluates to true *or* false. Consequently, just as every
if statement has a true branch it must also have a false branch. This is represented by the `else:`
part of an if-else or an if-elif-else statement.

```python
---
code: |
  if something_is_true:
    # This is the true branch
    # Do the true things
  else:
    # This is the false branch
    # Do the false things
---
```
or
```python
---
code: |
  if something_is_true:
    # This is the true branch
    # Do the true things
  elif something_else_is_true:
    # This is another true branch
    # Do different true things
  elif another_thing_is_true:
    # This is another true branch
    # Yes, everyone has their truth!
  else:
    # This is the false branch. All the true branches must 
    # have failed to get here.
    # Do the false things
---
```
In our app code we have three if statements nested within one another. Each of our if statements
also requires a false branch, where we can display exit screens 3, 5 and 7.

Let's do this one at a time.

:::note
A challenge with nesting if statements is that the corresponding `else` **must** line up with
the `if` that it belongs to. As nested if statements get bigger and bigger it becomes a challenge
to line up an `else` that's far away from its `if`. 

This is why we'll start from the bottom of our nested if statements and work out to the top.
:::

#### False branch if exceeding the s 58(2) limit
For convenience here's what our mandatory code block should look like:
```yml
---
mandatory: True
code: |
  if MJFis_gratuitous:
    if MJFwho_provided != 'Someone Else':
      if MJFamount_claimed <= MJFavg_earnings:
        exit_screen8
---
```
The s58(2) limit decision is the last one made (check the flowchart), and it's consequently the last of our nested if statements.  Add a false branch by adding an `else:` statement that displays
screen 7.  Your code should look like this:

```yml
---
mandatory: True
code: |
  if MJFis_gratuitous:
    if MJFwho_provided != 'Someone Else':
      if MJFamount_claimed <= MJFavg_earnings
        exit_screen8
      else:
        exit_screen7
---
```
Note how the `else` lines up with its corresponding `if`. This is **essential** and many a student has shed many a tear for want of not lining up their `if`s and `else`s properly.

Please be a happy student.

#### False branch if Someone else provided the services
The next decision up from the bottom is the eligibility check for who provided the services, which is the test of the value of `MJFwho_provided`. Our statement tests if `MJFwho_provided` is *not* 'Someone Else'. If `MJFwho_provided` *is* 'Someone Else' then we need to display `exit_screen5`.

Modify your code block so that it contains this new false branch
```yml
---
mandatory: True
code: |
  if MJFis_gratuitous:
    if MJFwho_provided != 'Someone Else':
      if MJFamount_claimed <= MJFavg_earnings:
        exit_screen8
      else:
        exit_screen7
    else:
      exit_screen5
---
```
Note where this new `else` statement appears. It appears *below* our `MJFamount_claimed` if/else statement. Why? This is because, the entirety `MJFamount_claimed` if-else statement is executed inside the true branch of the `MJFamount_claimed` if-else statement. That is, we're only making a decision about `MJFamount_claimed` if the `MJFwho_provided != 'Someone Else'` test evaluates to `True`.

Note also that we have had to line up this `else` with the `if` for `MJFwho_provided`. You might be able to see now how lining up these `if`s and `else`s can be challenging.

#### False branch if services are not gratuitous
This is left as an exercise for you. Please be aware of the following
* The false branch must sit outside of the true branch for `MJFis_gratuitous`. 
* The true branch for `MJFis_gratuitous` contains two nested if statements. So, our false branch must sit outside these
* The `else` must align with the `if` for `MJFis_gratuitous`

Once you have done this you should now have a fully working app!

### Testing
Now that we have an app we need to test it. A thorough test involved testing out each possible combinations of answers that could be input into the app to ensure there are no bugs. Thankfully, our app is not too complicated and so this should not take too long.

* Test your app. Did you find any bugs?
