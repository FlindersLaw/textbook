import {DisplayChapter} from '@site/src/components';

In this workshop we'll build on the [Coding Workshop 4](/docs/coding_exercises/coding_workshop_4) code and:

1. Ask followup questions for some of the favourite things;
1. Display our favourite things as a PDF which the user can download and/or email to themselves; and
1. Display something meaningful when the user does not select any favourite things.

## Readings
By the time you get to this workshop you should be comfortable with
variables, data types, testing (all in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_02'/>) and
logic and if statements (<DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_03'/>).

To prepare for this workshop you should read through <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_05' />
and <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_08' />.
You might also want to look at the case studies in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_06' />.
