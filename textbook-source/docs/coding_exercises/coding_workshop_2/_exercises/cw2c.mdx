export const title = 'Exercise 2c'

    <span> (focus on discussion on final screens) </span>
    </div>

Let's modify the code from {Ex2a_c.title} and {Ex2b_c.title} and
build out the balance of our app
In this exercise we will implement the following:

<CW2c_f />

<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/coding_exercises/max.jpeg' align='right' size='10%' caption="This is Max. Max doesn't want to be sold" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
The work here is much like the work we did in {Ex2b_c.title} but more.  You need
to prepare <DisplayGlossaryItem item='questionblock' plural /> for each of the
three questions, and the two endpoints.

The 'You can sell your dog' endpoint should include additional text about not needing
to desex a dog if it is a livestock dog.  Much like {Ex2b_c.title}, you can use
[Mako if statements](/docs/textbook/chapter_04/00-50) in your question screen to 
display the relevant text depending on whether the dog is a livestock dog or not.

The 'You can't sell your dog' endpoing should point out the requirement to microchip
and desex your pet is a prerequisite to selling it according to the legislation.
