The EOA allows for 'protected' and 'unprotected' categories of discrimination.  If the
discrimination is of a 'protected' nature then the EOA allows for the EOC to deal with
the complaint.  If the discrimiation is 'unprotected' then an alternative body must
deal with the discrimination.

:::note
Remember, we are dealing with an [old version](../coding_workshop_3/#the-exercise) of the EOC!
:::

Let's code out the first two questions.

<CW3b_f />


In `questions.yml` create a <DisplayGlossaryItem item='questionblock' /> to ask the first
question and a question block for the grounds question.
* The first question is a 'Yes/No' type question.  You can use a [`yesno`](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#yesornoquestions)
or a [`yesnoradio`](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html/yes) datatype to capture responses.
* The grounds question requires a list of choices to be used.  You can use a
[dropdown menu](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html/yes) or
[radio buttons](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html/yes).
    :::note
    For the second ('On what grounds...') question we'll need to present the user with a 
    list of choices.  As we did in [Exercise 2a](/docs/coding_exercises/coding_workshop_2/cw2a) of
    Coding Workshop 2 we can use
    key/value pairs for the choices.  This time though, instead of using unique values for each
    choice, we can simply use `protected` for the protected grounds and `unprotected` for the
    unprotected grounds.  This saves us from having to write the mother of all if statements
    to deal with the 10 different grounds in the app.
    :::
* In `screens.yml` create a question block with an <DisplayGlossaryItem item='eventtag' />
for the first exit screen.  Set the tag to be `exit_ineligible`.
* In `screens.yml` create another two question blocks with <DisplayGlossaryItem item='eventtag' plural />
set to `exit_state_level` and `exit_other`.  For now put some simple explanatory text into the
`subquestion` part of each block.  We'll change these later.
* Now, remove the `pass` from the mandatory code block in `main.yml` and add if statements to implement the logic
in the flowchart. You will need to use a combination of if statements (for the first question) and 
`if/elif/else` statements (for the second question).
