This exercise is about setting ourselves up so that we can get organised.  We will to use
good coding structure, multiple files and a separate [project](/docs/textbook/chapter_01/00-30#1-navbar-and-playground-menu)
to keep ourselves organised:

1. Create a new [Project](https://docassemble.org/docs/playground.html#projects) in your Playground.  Call it `Ex3a`.
1. In your new project create these files:
    - `main.yml`
    - `questions.yml`
    - `templates.yml`
    - `screens.yml`
    - `code.yml`
1. In your `main.yml` add an `include` block which includes all these files (except `main.yml`!)
1. Create a <DisplayGlossaryItem item='mandatoryquestionblock' /> as a welcome screen.  Add some 
basic explanatory text that describes what this app is going to do.
1. Create a mandatory <DisplayGlossaryItem item='codeblock' /> underneath your question block.  The
code block should just contain a `pass` command in it.
