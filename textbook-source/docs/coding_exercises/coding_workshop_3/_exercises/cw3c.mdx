Let's buid out the post-category logic flow.

<CW3c_f />

### Question blocks
Create <DisplayGlossaryItem item='questionblock' plural />
to ask these questions:

#### Did the discrimination occur in public life
This is a yes/no question.  Use a `yesno` or a `yesnoradio` so we can store the answer as a
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='boolean'/>.

:::tip
If you have time find out what 'public life' means in the context of the EOA and add some
explanatory text.
:::

#### Proceeding at state or federal level
This question should present the two choices using a `radio` datatype.


#### What is your complaint related to
This question should contain all eight choices either as a `radio` or as a drop-down menu.
Sort the choices alphabetically (**Hint:** you have to to this manually).

:::note
Once again it's recommended to use key/value pairs for your complaint question.  That way
you don't need to insert long text such as 'Medical and Mental Health' into your code block
(which we will complete in the next exercise).
:::

### Update your exit screens
Once the question is done update the text in your `exit_state_level` question block to let the user
know they can contact the EOC for help.

Create a new exit screen with an <DisplayGlossaryItem item='eventtag' /> called `exit_federal_level`.
This screen should give the user direction as to how to contact the AHRC.
Modify your `exit_other` screen to display the value of the complaints question.

### Update your code block
Update  the logic in your code block  to implement the public life, 
state or federal, and complaint questions.

For the complaint question, it doesn't matter whether the user answers true or false.
Just direct them to the `exit_other` screen for now.

:::note
You already have an if statement that determines whether the user has selected
a protected ground or not. The true branch of that if statement should contain
the logic for the public life and state or federal question.  The false branch
will contain the complaint question.
:::

:::tip Hint
You will need to use nested if statements to implement the true side for the
protected branch.
:::

:::tip Hint
Use an if statement to test the complaint question's answer.  For now
use an if/else statement and have both branches call `exit_other`.
