Create a program which does the following:

- ask for the user's name and for the user's age;
- If the user is under 18 then display:
  > Hello **name**, you are just a child!
- If the user is over 18 but less than 50 then display:
  > Hello **name**, you are an adult.
- If the user is over 65 then display:
  > Hello **name**, you are an adult and are eligible for the age pension.

:::tip Hint
Use if statements and `elif` to manage testing for the different age ranges.
