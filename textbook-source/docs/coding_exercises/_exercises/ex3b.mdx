import {DisplayGlossaryItem} from '@site/src/components';

export const title = 'Ex3b';
export const video = 'All videos from C1, C2, C3 plus C4.01';

Implement the flowchart in **Ex2f** but with these modifications:

* Make the app look beautiful

In the final screen make these changes:

* Display the list of patients using a <DisplayGlossaryItem item='tableblock' />.
* If no patients are selected the do not display a table block.  Instead, explain that no records were selected for display.
