Modify your **{Ex1b.title}** code to:

- add exit and restart buttons;
- re-format your question block so that the question is asked in the `subquestion` tag;
- Diplay the user's name in **bold**; and
- when pressing <DisplayDAButtons button={da_exit_prop} /> your app should send you to the [Flinders University BGL website](https://flinders.edu.au/cbgl).
