Finally, we'll build out the `exit_other` screen.  We'll use a single 
screen but we'll populate it with templates depending on how the user
answers the complaints question.

<CW3d_f />

### Set up templates.
We don't want to set up eight different exit screens, that's too unwieldy. Instead, we'll
keep our `exit_other` screen and we'll insert the relevant
[template block](https://docassemble.org/docs/initial.html#template) in it, depending
on how the user answers the question.

Even though we have eight options, we actually only have six endpoints.  This is because the
'Housing Dispute', 'Medical and Mental Health' and 'Review of Government decisions' choices all
diret to a 'Refer to SACAT' endpoint.  That saves us a bit of work.

So, create six templates in `templates.yml`.  Each template need only have a name (which is the variable name)
and a `content` tag. There's no need for a subject tag.  Eg:
```yml
---
template: sacat
content: |
  Text in there about referring to SACAT
---
```
### Create a new code block
Before we get into the code block, please be aware that, when displaying out output there's
more than one way to [skin a cat](/docs/coding_exercises/coding_workshop_2) (see the bottom of that page).

In our case, we could either create a code block to select the right template, or we could
simply embed the code into our `exit_other` screen using <DisplayGlossaryItem item='mako' upper/>
if statements.  If so, our `exit_other` code would look something like this:
```yml
---
event: exit_other
question: Further assistance
subquestion: |
  Some explanatory text goes here, then display the template.

  %if CW3complaint == 'workplace':
  ${saet_template}
  %elif CW3complaint == 'whs':
  ${safework_template}
  %elif CW3complaint == 'cbs':
  ${cbs_template}
  ... and so-on five more times
  %endif
buttons:
  - Restart: restart
  - Exit: exit
---
```
While this is *possible*, it's not really *elegant*.  It clutters our end screen, which is 
used to display content, with logic.  A more elegant solution would be to have the end
screen display a template like this:
```yml
---
event: exit_other
question: Further assistance
subquestion: |
  Some explanatory text goes here, then display the template.

  ${display_template}
buttons:
  - Restart: restart
  - Exit: exit
---
```
Much cleaner and concise(r).

What we can then do is write a code block to set the variable `display_template` based 
on the answer from the complaint question.

#### The mother of all `if/elif` statements
Create a code block in `code.yml`.  That code block should contain a very large `if/elif/else`
statement. Each `elif` branch should deal with one of the possible choices coming from the
complaints quesiton.  Each `elif` branch should set the variable `display_template` to be
the relevant template you created [above](#set-up-templates).

:::tip
As three of the choices all direct to the SACAT template you can reduce the number of 
`elif`s by using logical 'or' tests to test those three choices at once.
:::

:::note
It's good practice to always have an `else` branch to any `if/elif` statement.  Your `else`
branch should never be used but is there just in case your app gets modified later and, 
for example, a new choice gets added to the question. 

You can use [`format()`](/docs/textbook/chapter_03/00-20#using-format) to add the value
of your variable to any error string you might want to construct.

### Bringing it all together
Congratulations! You should now have a complete version of your app.  Open your `main.yml` file in your
Playground project and run your app to see if it works!
