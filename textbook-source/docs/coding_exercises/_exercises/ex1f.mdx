import * as Ex1e from './ex1e.mdx';
import Ref from './references/ex1f.mdx';

export const title = 'Exercise 1f';
export const video = <Ref />

Extend your code from **{Ex1e.title}** to do the following:

* ask for the user's annual income;
* the term 'annual income' should have a pop-up that defines what annual income means;
* If the user inputs an income, it should be displayed in the final screen as currency
(hint: use the [`currency()`](https://docassemble.org/docs/functions.html#currency) function)
* If the user inputs an income of $0, then the text 'you do not earn an income' should be displayed in the final screen.

:::note Example output
> Hello Hansel Forrest, you are an adult and your annual income is $45,000.
