## Access the Docassemble Server
Before you start the Coding 1 exercises you must have gained access to
the <DisplayConstants data={dahref} />.  See <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_01' />
for instructions.

## Read the Textbook
Make sure you have read through and are comfortable with these parts of this textbook:
* All of <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_01' />
* All of <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_02' /> except
for <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_02' pinpoint='00-50' text='Hello World 5 - Introducing Jinja'/>
* All of <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_03' /> 

## Watch the videos
Watch these videos
* C1.01
* C1.02
* C1.03
* C1.04 - but start from 02:10
* C1.06

### A note on the videos
You will notice that the videos were produced for a topic called LLAW3301 Law in a Digital Age. This is the predecessor topic to Digital Lawyer. Despite this the videos are still very useful resources as most of Chapter 2 of ULT was based on them. You might want to read each part of Chapter 2 and watch each video in turn.  If so, here's a handy table:

<Resources.ChapterVideoTable />

## Other Handy Tips
Other handy tips:
* You can copy and paste the code referred to in each video from each chapter part. The videos may refer to the code by different names but the code is the same.
* Ignore references to 'Law in a Digital Age'. Pretend that I'm saying 'Digital Lawyer' instead ðŸ˜Š.
* Some videos refer to you working in groups. Ignore this. The Digital Age topic was heavily group-based, where this topic does not contain any (assessed) group work.
* Don't forget to ignore references to GitHub.
