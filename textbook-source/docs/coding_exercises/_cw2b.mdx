import {DisplayChapter} from '@site/src/components';
import {DisplayGlossaryItem} from '@site/src/components';
import CW2b_f from './_cw2b_flowchart1.mdx';
import * as Ex2a_c from './_cw2a.mdx';

export const title = 'Ex2b'
export const video = <div>
    <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_03' number />
    <span> Text </span>
    <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_03' number />
    </div>

Let's modify the code from {Ex2a_c.title} and build out the next part of our app.
In this exercise we will implement the following:

<CW2b_f />

For this you will need these question screens:
* Ask if the user wants to sell their pet
* Ask if the user is a breeder
* Ask if the user's pet is a livestock dog

The chart shows three exit screens but you should consolidate the two left
screens into one using [templates](https://docassemble.org/docs/initial.html#template).

:::tip TODO
We need a 'bits and pieces' area where we can talk about templates
:::

Once the screens are made,  update the mandatory code block with nested
if statements to direct the user to the appropriate screen.

:::tip
Your nested if statement should go where we had entered `pass` in
{Ex2a_c.title}.
