Modify your **Ex1c** code to:

- add a question to ask for your salutation;
- replace the name question with two fields for a first and last name;
- display the output in a table. The table should contain two rows with:
  - the first row containing the name.  It should display the full name (ie: join the salutation, first and last names together); and
  - the second row shoudl contain the age.
