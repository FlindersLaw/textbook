## The Exercise
In this exercise you will build a Section **52** Calculator App. The app will be based on the
[flowchart](s52_calculator_chart.mdx) and [screens](s52_calculator_screens.mdx) that appear as the resources for this exercise.

Unlike the last two weeks you will not be provided with step-by-step instructions. The principles for this Section 52 app are more or less identical to the Section 58 app. The difference in the Section 52 app is the calculations are a bit more complex.

Consequently, we anticipate you'll use the same approach to develop this Section 52 app ie:
1. Make the first mandatory question block
1. Make an empty mandatory code block
1. Make the rest of the question blocks
    * follow the instruction in each screen. There are instructions on setting out the questions and the datatypes
    * update the code block to call them as you go
1. Make *End Screen 1* and add it to your code block
1. Add if statements so the user is exited to *Exit Screen 1* and *Exit Screen 2*
1. Add an if statement for the 'Year of injury' decision. Make both the true branch and false branch to go *End Screen 1*

:::note
Before you jump into things, you'll see that this app contains more screens, more decisions (and more maths!) than the previous app. You might want to consider using [`include` blocks](/docs/recipes/structuring_code) to split your code into multiple files to make it more manageable.
:::

### Adding the calculations
If you wish you can attempt to add the calculations yourself. However, we anticipate you might struggle as we haven't taught you how to implement lookup tables in Docassemble.  Nonetheless, you're welcome to try!

For those of you less adventurous, we have created a file called `s52calculator_maths.yml` for you. It contains all the mathematical calculations. All the maths are based only on two variables: `
* `MJFyearofinjury` which contains only the year (ie: 2002, 2024 etc) the user was injured; and
* `MJFscalevalue` - which contains the s 52(2)(a) scale value.

You can insert our example code and change all references to these two variables to whatever variable names you have chosen.  The calculations should then work.

### Displaying the calculations
*End Screen 1* contains placeholders called `[insert unadjusted damages]` and `[insert adjusted damages]`. This is where you're meant to insert your unadjusted and adjusted damages.

To do this you should use use <DisplayGlossaryItem item='mako' /> and the `currency()` function. Check out the <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_02' pinpoint='00-60' text='Vital Statistics' /> example in this textbook. You may also want to review the [C1.06 video](coding_1_prerequisites#watch-the-videos).

## Solution Code
This code adopts the [code structuring](/docs/recipes/structuring_code) discussed above. Namely, the solution code is split into multiple files.  We do this because a single file with hundreds of lines of code can become unwieldy to manage. Also, the use of multiple files allows us to organise our code logically.

In this example we've decided to put the main code logic and the exit and end screens in `main.yml`. We have then created a separate file for the questions (`s52calculator_questions.yml`) and another file for the math calculations (`s52calculator_maths.yml`)

question: Ineligible
subquestion: |
  You cannot claim damages for non-economic loss as your medical
  expenses do not exceed the prescribed minimum.

# Exit Screen 2
event: MJFexit02
question: Motor Vehicle Accident
subquestion: |
  Sorry, this calculator only calculates damages for non-economic loss for people
  who have suffered an injury **not** arising from a motor vehicle accident.

  You may still be able to claim damages for non-economic loss. Please seek legal advice.
buttons:
  - Exit: exit
  - Restart: restart

# End screen
event: MJFend01
question: Damages Calculation
subquestion: |
  Your unadjusted damages has been calculated to be **${currency(MJFunadjusted_damages)}**.

  After adjustment for CPI your damages for non-economic loss have been
  calculated to be **${currency(MJFadjusted_damages)}**.
