Extend your code from **Ex1f** to do the following:

* ask if the user has a partner;
* if the user has a partner, then ask for the partner's name and partner's income;
* display the total household income (which is the sum of the two incomes) on the final screen;
* display the average household income on the final screen

:::note Example Output
> Hello Hansel Forrest.
> Your partner's name is Gretel Forrest
> Your annual income is $45,000 and Gretel Forrest's annual income is $30,000
> Your total household income is $75,000
> Your average household income is $37,500

:::tip Hints
* You can use `show if` to display the partner details if the user has a partner
* Remember to account for the case when the user does not have a partner when you create the total household and average household incomes - have another look at Video C1.06
