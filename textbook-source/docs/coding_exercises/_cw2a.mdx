Add proper references to chapters
:::

We are going to create this part of the app:
<CW2a_f />

We need to make:
* the welcome screen
* A screen to ask the user what pet they own
* An exit screen for users that don't own a dog or cat
* some code to drive our app

#### Welcome Screen
Let's start with a <DisplayGlossaryItem item='mandatoryquestionblock' /> that 
displays a welcome screen explaining what this app does. You may also want to
include a disclaimer stating that this app does not provide legal advice.

#### Question Screen
Create a <DisplayGlossaryItem item='questionblock' /> that asks the user what
kind of pet they have.  They should be able to choose from this list:
* Cat
* Dog
* Fish
* Crocodile
* Something else

Use [radio buttons](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#radio) to present the choices.  Also,
use [key/value pairs](https://docassemble.org/docs/fields.html#choices) to help in making the names
easier for the user to read your code easier to process eg:
```yml
...
fields:
  - What is your pet?: W2pet
    choices:
      - Dog: dog
      - Cat: cat
      ...
      - Something else: other
---
```
#### Exit Screen
Create a <DisplayGlossaryItem item='questionblock' /> with an <DisplayGlossaryItem item='eventtag' />
and set the event tag as `W2ineligible`. The contents of this question block should explain to users
that 

:::tip TODO
Need part of ch 2 that deals with event screens

Where do we introduce code blocks?  Maybe introduce the welcome screen -> mandatory code block
-> final screen template in ch 2?
:::

#### Code block
Just below your Welcome screen you should create a mandatory <DisplayGlossaryItem item='codeblock' />.
The code block should use an if statement to check if the value of `W2pet`. If `W2pet` is `cat` or `dog`
then we shouldn't do anything (that will come later).  Just put `pass` under this part of the if statement.
If the user hasn't chosen cat or dog then the exit screen should be displayed.
