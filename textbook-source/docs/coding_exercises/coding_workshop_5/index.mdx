title: Coding Workshop 5

import {DisplayChapter} from '@site/src/components';

In this workshop we're going to further explore the working of complex data structures
and iteration.  We'll use a data block as a database and filter that database to 
display only relevant information.

In this Workshop we are going to complete a homelessness services app.  You
will be provided with skeleton code which you need to get the app to work and
a spreadsheet with a list of services the app should use.

Over the course of these exercises we will gradually build out our skeleton code
into a fully functioning app.

## Readings
By the time you get to this workshop you should be comfortable with
variables, data types, testing (all in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_02'/>) and
logic and if statements (<DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_03'/>).

To prepare for this workshop you should read through <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_05' />.
You might also want to look at the case studies in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_06' />.
