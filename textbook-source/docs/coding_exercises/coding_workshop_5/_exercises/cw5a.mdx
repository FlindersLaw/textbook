## Background
In this exercise we're going to take the code from [Exercise 4c](../coding_workshop_4/cw4c) from
[Coding Workshop 4](../coding_workshop_4/) and build on it so that we:
1. ask followup questions;
1. display something meaningful if the user does not select any categories.

### Asking followup questions
We're going to ask two questions and we're going to implement them in two different ways.  Both ways are equally valid and have their (slight) advantages and disadvantages, as we'll discuss in class.

#### Whiskers on Kittens
It may be that many people like whiskers but not on kittens.  We're going to add some other animals on which people might like whiskers.  If people select 'Whiskers on Kittens' they'll be asked a followup question confirming which animal they *really* like whiskers on.

We'll implement this followup question using a nested `if/elif` statement, much like how we did in
[Coding Workshop 3](../coding_workshop_3/).

#### Warm Woolen Mittens
Again, we want to give people choice.  If a user selects 'Warm Woolen Mittens' we want to ask a followup question so we can determine what colour they'd prefer their warm woolen mittens to be.

We'll implement this followup question directly in the `t_mittens` template.

### The 'empty list' case.
You'll see in the code that it's possible for a user to select `None of the above` instead of one of the faviourite things.
What happens when a user does that? You'll see that nothing gets displayed on the final screen.
That can be confusing for a user. If a user doesn't select any category we should display some text acknowledging that.

If a user doesn't select any favourite things, then `template_list` will be empty.
Therefore, we should check that `template_list` has at least one element in it, or does not  have zero elements.  We'll use the `len()` function to do this.
You can find out more about finding the length of a list
in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_05' pinpoint='00-20#list-length' text='Chapter 5' />.

## Steps
1. Make a new Playground [Project](/docs/recipes/making_a_project) called `CodingWorkshop5`
1. Copy the [example code](#code) below into files in your `CodingWorkshop5` playground. The file names must **match exactly**.
1. Complete the code in `cw4c_code.yml` so that templates are appended to `temp` for each animal in the `whiskers_followup` question.
1. Add a <DisplayGlossaryItem item='mako' upper /> if statement to the `t_mittens` template so that appropriately coloured mittens are displayed depending on the value of `mitten_colour`.
1. Add a Make `% if` statement to the final screen so that the `% for` loop is run only if the length of `template_list` is not zero.
If the length of the `template_list` is zero, then display some text on the screen stating the user hasn't selected any items.
