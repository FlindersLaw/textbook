# Coding Exercises
These exercises provide a pathway for working your way through the textbook, starting
with basic exercises and slowly working up to more sophisticated examples.  These
exercises are also closely related to your Assessment B and they cover all the aspects
of coding you will require to complete Assessments B1, B2 and B3.

## Getting Prepared
The best way for you to become familiar with coding and with these exercises is to try
them yourself.  In fact, working through these exercises is a better way to to work through
the textbook than reading through it.  Each exercise has links to recommended reading.  
Do those readings and then try the exercises.

## Coding Workshops
We have broken down the coding exercises into Coding Workshops.  We will cover as
much of  each set of exercises in the specified Coding Workshop.  If we run out
of time we will focus on the latter exercises.  Therefore, it's a good idea for you
to have attempted the exercises before you attend the workshops

This set of exercises introduces you to decision-making logic using if statements.

We'll work on implementing this flowchart to help dog and cat owners who are 
iterested in selling their dog or cat (the only good cat is a dead cat).

Work through each exercise in order to complete the full version of this app.
