title: Coding Workshop 4

import {DisplayChapter} from '@site/src/components';

In this set of exercises we start working on iteration and also touch on using attachments.

You will use all these concepts in Assessment B2

## Readings
Please make sure you have read through:
* all of the readings for the previous Coding Workshops
* <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_05' />, except for 'Complex Data and
Data Storage' and 'Complex Data Recap'



## Ex4b
- `DAList()`
- Display items that contain the letter H in them

## Ex4c
- checkboxes
- Display a list of selected items
- If no items are selected then display text stating as much
Hint: use templates

## Ex4d
Modify 4d to display:
- A line stating how many items are selected and how many are not selected
- All items displayed in a table, along with whether they have been selected or not
  - a challenge would be to replace `True` and `False` with meaningful words
- If no items are selected then display text stating as much

## Ex4e
- Modify 4d to display results in an attachment as well as screen
Hints:
 - use `attachments` as a block on its own (show example in manual)
   - remember to give it a `variable name`
 - use `attachment code` in the main question block
 - pass a 'list' of attachments to `attachment code`. Create a code block
 that creates a list with a single item (ie: the attachemnt) if anyone has
 been selected, and an empty list if nobody has been selected.
