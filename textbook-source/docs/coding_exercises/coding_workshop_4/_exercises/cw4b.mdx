import {DisplayGlossaryItem} from '@site/src/components';
import {DisplayImage} from '@site/src/components';
import Ref from './cw4b_references.mdx';

export const title = 'Exercise 4b'
export const video = <Ref />

## Background
In this exercise we are looking at <DisplayGlossaryItem item='dictionary' plural /> and iteration.

You will modify the [code](#code) below and:
1. add some items to `favourite_things`; and
1. display the contents of `favourite_things` in a table

That is, you should display the list so that the output of the list looks something like this:

<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/coding_exercises/cw4b-1.png' size="70%" />

## Steps
1. Copy the [example code](#code) below into a file called `cw4b.yml` in your `CodingWorkshop4` playground
1. Delete 'First Choice' and 'Second Choice' from the `favourite_things` question and replace them with five of your own choices
1. Use a <DisplayGlossaryItem item='mako' upper /> `for` loop to display the checkbox items in a table showing which items were selected

:::tip hints
#### Adding choices
This is very simple. Just find the `choices:` part of the question and replace the two choices with five of your own.

#### Displaying in a table
First, the table header has been created for you already. All you need to do is replace the line
```
  ${favourite_things}
```
with a `for` loop.  Like Exercise 4a you will only need three lines of code.  The body of the loop (the part between `% for` and `% endfor`) will be a bit more complex.
You need to display the dictionary key (which is the text) and the dictionary value.  Refer to the readings for how to do this.

  In this exercise we look at a `checkboxes` data type and use iteration
  to display each element in our variable.

  Checkboxes are dictionaries.  Each checkbox item is the key and the value of
  each item is `True` or `False` depening on whether that item has been checked or not.

  Even though a checkbox is a dictionary, we can still treat it as a list by iterating
  over its keys.
