export const title = 'Exercise 4b'
export const video = <Ref />

## Background
In this exercise we are looking at <DisplayGlossaryItem item='dictionary' plural /> and iteration.

You will modify the [code](#code) below and:
1. add some items to `favourite_things`; and
1. display the contents of `favourite_things` in a table

That is, you should display the list so that the output of the list looks something like this:

<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/coding_exercises/cw4b-1.png' size="70%" />

## Steps
1. Copy the [example code](#code) below into a file called `cw4b.yml` in your `CodingWorkshop4` playground
1. Delete 'First Choice' and 'Second Choice' from the `favourite_things` question and replace them with five of your own choices
1. Use a <DisplayGlossaryItem item='mako' upper /> `for` loop to display the checkbox items in a table showing which items were selected

:::tip hints
#### Adding choices
This is very simple. Just find the `choices:` part of the question and replace the two choices with five of your own.

#### Displaying in a table
First, the table header has been created for you already. All you need to do is replace the line
```
  ${favourite_things}
```
with a `for` loop.  Like Exercise 4a you will only need three lines of code.  The body of the loop (the part between `% for` and `% endfor`) will be a bit more complex.
You need to display the dictionary key (which is the text) and the dictionary value.  Refer to the readings for how to do this.
