## Ex4e
- Modify 4d to display results in an attachment as well as screen
Hints:
 - use `attachments` as a block on its own (show example in manual)
   - remember to give it a `variable name`
 - use `attachment code` in the main question block
 - pass a 'list' of attachments to `attachment code`. Create a code block
 that creates a list with a single item (ie: the attachemnt) if anyone has
 been selected, and an empty list if nobody has been selected.

## Background
In this exercises we'll work on our code {Ex4d.title} and create a PDF attachment
for the user to download or email to themselves.

## Task
:::note
You must have completed [{Ex4d.title}](cw4d) before commencing this exercise.
:::

Modify your code so that if any names are selected, the same table as in 
{Ex4d.title} is displayed but also a PDF is made available for download.  However,
if no names are selected then no attachment should be created.

## Task notes
The first thing to do is to create the Word document template.  We suggest that
you display the selected names in a [Word table](https://docassemble.org/docs/documents.html#docx%20tables)
using Jinja code.

Once the you've created your attachment you can add an
[attachment specifier](https://docassemble.org/docs/documents.html#attachment) to your final screen
to display the attachment and make sure it works.  You'll only need to test your
attachment for the use case where at least one name is selected.  You don't need
to test for the no names selected use case.

Once we've got the attachment sorted we need to find a way to display the attachment on our final 
screen *only if* more than one name is selected.  For this we'll use
[`attachment code`](https://docassemble.org/docs/documents.html#attachment%20code). 
`attachment code` allows us to provide a list of attachments to display.  Importantly, if the 
list is empty then no attachment will be displayed!  Therefore, what we can do is 
create a list with a single attachment in it if one or more names is selected, and create
an empty list if no names are selected.  We should do this in a
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='codeblock' />.  Let's get back to that later.

As we're using `attachment code` we need to remove our `attachment` from the final screen
and set it up [as its own block](https://docassemble.org/docs/documents.html#variable%20name) and
assign it a variable name. Then we can reference that variable name in our list-making code block.

Overall, our code should look something like this:
```yml
---
objects:
  - display_names: DAList.using(auto_gather=False)
---
mandatory: True
question: Coding Workshop 4e
subquestion: |
  Final screen text and code goes here
  ...
attachment code: CWdoc_list
buttons:
  - Exit: exit
  - Restart: restart
---
other code blocks from Ex4d go here
---
attachment:
  set up our attachment here
  remember to assign it a variable name
---
code: |
  set the value of CWdoc_list depending on whether
  any names were checked.
  Hint: use an if statement
---
```
