## Ex4e
- Modify 4d to display results in an attachment as well as screen
Hints:
 - use `attachments` as a block on its own (show example in manual)
   - remember to give it a `variable name`
 - use `attachment code` in the main question block
 - pass a 'list' of attachments to `attachment code`. Create a code block
 that creates a list with a single item (ie: the attachemnt) if anyone has
 been selected, and an empty list if nobody has been selected.
