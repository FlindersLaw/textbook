## Ex4d
Modify 4d to display:
- A line stating how many items are selected and how many are not selected
- All items displayed in a table, along with whether they have been selected or not
  - a challenge would be to replace `True` and `False` with meaningful words
- If no items are selected then display text stating as much

## Background
In this exercise we'll start getting a little more sophisticated as to how
we display our results.

This exercise is based on your code from [{Ex4c.title}](cw4c).  You must have completed
{Ex4c.title} before you start this exercise.

## Task
Your app should be modified to behave as follows:
1.  The final screen should display a line summarising how many names
were selected and how many were not.
1. The final screen should also display the list of names in a table,
with the first column being the name and the second being the selection
status.
1. If no names are selected then a message stating no names were selectd should be
displayed (much like {Ex4c.title}).

Your output should look something like this:

<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/coding_exercises/cw4d-1.png' />

:::tip 
You already have a template for displaying the list output that you made
in {Ex4c.title}.  Use this same template but replace the list with a 
Markdown table.  You'll need to create the table headers yourself and the 
`%for` loop should now display the two table columns.  The first column 
will contain the key and the second column will display the value 
associated with that key.

Python has a `len()` function that will tell you how many elements there are
in a list. Use this against `CWpeople.true_values()` to see how many names
have been selected.  If `len(CWpeople.true_values())` is zero then you know 
no names were selected.

:::tip challenge
Displaying 'True' and 'False' in the right-hand column isn't that intuitive
to lay people that are not the programming geniuses that you now are. It would
be better to display 'Selected' and 'Not selected' instead.  See if you 
can implement this.
