export const title = 'Exercise 4a'
export const video = <Ref />

## Background
In this exercise we are looking at <DisplayGlossaryItem item='list' plural /> and iteration.

You will modify the [code](#code) below and:
1. add some items to `display_list`; and
1. display the contents of `display_list` as a bullet list.  

That is, you should display the list so that the output of the list looks something like this:

<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/coding_exercises/cw4a-1.png' size="70%" />

## Steps
1. Create a new [Playground Project](/docs/recipes/making_a_project) called `CodingWorkshop4`
2. Copy the [example code](#code) below into a file called `cw4a.yml`
3. Add an extra four names to `display_list`
4. Use a <DisplayGlossaryItem item='mako' upper /> `for` loop to display the list items formatted as a bullet list
  :::tip hints
  #### Adding the names to the list
  There's a code block at the end of the example code.  The first name has been added for you. Use this as an example.

  #### Displaying the bullet list
  To display the bullet list you will need to:
  
  1.delete this line from `final_screen`
  ```
    ${display_list}
  ```
  2 replace that line with your `for` loop.  You should only need three lines of code
