## Background
The code for this exercise is supplied for you below.  You should copy this code into your Playground
so you can modify it according to this exercise.

:::tip
You might want to consider setting up a new
[Playground Project](/docs/textbook/chapter_01/00-30#1-navbar-and-playground-menu)
for these coding exercises.
:::

This code contains a single <DisplayGlossaryItem item='mandatoryquestionblock' /> and a single
<DisplayGlossaryItem item='codeblock' />.  The code block defines a list called `display_list`.

## Your Task
In this exercise you must modify the code to display the contents of `display_list` as a bullet list.  
That is, you should display the list so that the output of the list is as follows:

<DisplayImage imageURL='/img/coding_exercises/cw4a-1.png' size="70%" />

Currently line 11 of the code has a <DisplayGlossaryItem item='mako' upper /> command that
displays the list items as, well, a list!  Start by removing that line.  You will need to
replace that line with a Mako for loop.

You should only require an additional three lines of code to complete this exercise.

## Code
Copy this code into your playground as a starting point for this exercise.
