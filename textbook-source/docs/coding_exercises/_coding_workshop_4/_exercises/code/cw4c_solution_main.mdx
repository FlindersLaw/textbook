  In this exercise we look at a `checkboxes` data type and use iteration
  to display each element in our variable.

  Checkboxes are dictionaries.  Each checkbox item is the key and the value of
  each item is `True` or `False` depening on whether that item has been checked or not.

  Even though a checkbox is a dictionary, we can still treat it as a list by iterating
  over its keys.
