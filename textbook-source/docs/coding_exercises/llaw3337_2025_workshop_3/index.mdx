In this workshop, we will complete our flowchart. We're also going to look at how to make our app beautiful.

Styling of apps is managed through *Cascading Style Sheets* or CSS.
CSS is the industry standard when it comes to setting out the layout, fonts, colours, images and anythhing to do with the appearance of a web app.

## Pre-reading
* <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_07' />
* You will also need to complete the readings from LLAW3337 workshop 2.

## Background
Chapter 7 describes how to style a Docassemble app.  It provides a great starting point for us as all Docassemble apps contain the same standard elements to style.  So, we can take the
Chapter 7 <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_07' pinpoint='00-30' text='solution code' />, or at least the `styles.css` file, and add it to our existing code.  That gives us a fully styled app that we can work on.

We are going to work in our `CodingWorkshop5` Project.  We will use the code from [Exercise 5b](/docs/coding_exercises/coding_workshop_5/cw5b) and work from there.

## Steps
### Let's get ready
1. Go to your `CodingWorkshop5` project
1. Copy <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_07' pinpoint='00-30#stylescss' text='styles.css'  lower /> from Chapter 7 into your `Static Files` folder.
1. Copy <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_07' pinpoint='00-30#flinderslogopng' text='Flinders Logo' /> from Chapter 7 into your `Static Files` folder.
1. Add a `features` block and a `css` feature into your main program (should be `cw5b_main_solution.yml`)
1. Add this code below your `features` block.  This is used to display the logo.
```yml
---
objects:
  - MJFlogo: DAStaticFile.using(filename='flinders_logo.png')
---
mandatory: True
code: |
  set_parts(logo='<img src="' + MJFlogo.url_for() + '" style="height: 50px;">')
---
```
1. Run your application.  It should look like this:
    <DisplayImage imageURL='/img/coding_exercises/cw6-1.png' caption='Look at the pretty colours!!' />

### Tasks
1. Change the colour of the menu bar.  Pick your own colour.
1. Change the colour of the <DisplayDAButtons button={da_restart_prop} /> button.
1. Replace the Flinders logo with the logo from the Assessment design.
1. Change the background colour of the main screen
  :::tip hint
  You will need to use the <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_07' pinpoint='00-10#accessing-developer-tools' text='Developer Tools' /> to find the element to style.

:::note challenge
Try changing the fonts in the app.  The Case Study in <DisplayChapter chapter='chapter_06' /> will give you some guidance.
