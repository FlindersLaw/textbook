  Welcome to Ross and Keith Smith Aviation Law's Aviation Enquiry Tool.

  We get quite a few enquiries from pilots about matters to do with their
  logbooks, logging time and how much they can charge their passengers.

  This app allows you to navigate these questions yourself and provide you
  with some immediate assistance without necessarily needing to book time
  with us.

  **Disclaimer:**

  This app **is not** a substitute for providing legal advice.  It is a means
  to give you some information and refer you to the relevant legislation.  If
  you need advice on these matters please contact us to make an appointment.
