You can use CSS to control how your raw HTML looks.  For example, the `div`\n  block below is linked to a CSS style called `MJFbox`.  If you find `MJFbox` in the CSS\n  file you will see the commands that set the border, text colour and font style.\n\n  <div class=\"MJFbox\">\n  <p>This text appears in a <code>div</code> block and is formatted according to\n  the <code>MJFbox</code> style.</p>\n  \n  <p><span class=\"MJFbolder\">Note:</span> It's not always possible to use Markdown in <code>div</code>\n  blocks.
