Regulation 61.080 defines flight time for a pilot as the 'duration' of certain\n  flights.\n  \n  The term 'duration' is defined in reg 61.010, and for a flight in an aeroplane means\n  'the time from the moment the aircraft begins moving...in preparation for flight...until the\n  moment it comes to rest at the end of the flight'.\n\n---\ntemplate: logbook_info\nsubject: Logbooks - Information that must be kept in your pilot's logbook\ncontent: |\n  CASR regulations 61.345(2) and (3) set out what must be recorded in a pilot's logbook.\n  \n  You must include:\n\n  * Your full name and date of birth;\n  * the date the flight began;\n  * the type of aircraft, its registration and whether it is single or multi-engine\n  * take-off and landing points for the flight and each segment of the flight\n  * the flight time\n  * whether the flight was a daytime or night-time flight, or both;\n  * any instrument time; and\n  * any instrument approaches conducted.\n\n  This is not a comprehensive list but serves as a summary of the requirements.  The requirements\n  for actual flights and also flights conducted in an approved simulator are set out in\n  regs 61.345(3) and 61.345(4) respectively.\n\n  Non-compliance with reg 61.345 makes a pilot liable for a 50 penalty unit fine, amounting\n  to $13,750 at the time this information was written.\n---\ntemplate: logbook_retention\nsubject: Logbooks - Retaining your old pilot's logbooks\ncontent: |\n  Paper logbooks must be retained for **7 years** after the date of the last entry\n  in the logbook (CASR r 31.355(b)).  The CASRs do not specifically mention retention\n  periods for online logbook entries.\n\n  A pilot is liable for a 50 penalty unit fine ($13,750 at time of writing) for not properly\n  retaining old logbooks\n---\ntemplate: logbook_online\nsubject: Logbooks - Keeping an online logbook\ncontent: | \n  A pilot's logbook must comply with CASR regulations 61.345, 61.355,\n  61.360 and 61.365.  Online logbooks\n  must meet the same criteria as paper logbooks but must also meet the \n  additional requirements set out in CASR r 61.365(3).  Specifically:\n\n  - the logbook holder must be able to print a copy of the logbook (CASR r 61.365(3)(a)); and\n  - each printed page must be certified by the logbook holder (CASR r 61.365(3)(b)).\n\n  In addition, CASR reg 61.355(2)(b) states that logbook entries cannot be altered.  This is\n  a particular challenge for pilots keeping their logbooks online.  This regulation means\n  that logbooks kept in software such as Microsoft Excel\n  or Google Sheets **are not valid online logbooks** as entries can be altered.\n\n  There are commercial logbook providers, such as\n  [lockr.aero](https://lockr.aero), [BreezyLog](https://breezylog.com) and\n  [MyFlightBook](https://myflightbook.com) that you can subscribe to.  However,\n  before doing so you should confirm with the provider that they meet the\n  relevant CASRs. The liability for logbook compliance rests with you, not\n  the provider.\n\n  Not properly keeping an online logbook exposes the holder to a fine of\n  50 penalty units, or $13,750 at the time of writing.\n---\ntemplate: pax_rpc\nsubject: Charging Passengers (RPC)\ncontent: |\n  An RPC holder should **not** seek any form of payment, in cash or otherwise,\n  for carrying a passenger or cargo on a flight.\n\n  A Recreational Pilot's Certificate is limited by Civil Aviation Order 95.55,\n  which sets the legislative framework for light sport aircraft (**LSA**) and their \n  governance by Recreational Aviation Australia Limited (**RAAus**).\n\n  Order 8.3 of CAO 95.55 states that a LSA cannot be used to carry passengers or cargo\n  for 'hire or reward'.  This phrase 'hire and reward' has been determined by a court \n  to have a very broad meaning and essentially means that a LSA pilot cannot ask for\n  any compensation, monetary or otherwise, for carrying a passenger.\n\n  This interpretation of 'hire or reward' prevents a LSA pilot from 'cost sharing' with a friend.  The pilot must\n  bear all the cost.  It also prevents a LSA pilot being compensated in some other\n  manner, for example, free accommodation in exchange for a flight.\n\n  Contravention of Order 8.3 may result in disciplinary action from CASA and/or RAAus.\n---\ntemplate: pax_rpl_ppl\nsubject: Charging Passengers (${rpl_ppl_short})\ncontent: |\n  If you hold a ${rpl_ppl_subject} then you may charge your passengers on a \n  'cost sharing' basis only.\n  \n  ${rpl_ppl_casr} allows a ${rpl_ppl_pilot} to exercise their licence only when\n  conducting 'private operations'.  The CASR Dictionary defines private operations to\n  mean, amongst other things, any operation that would *not* require an AOC under Part 119.\n\n  Part 119 requires an AOC for any 'air transport operation' which is defined in Part\n  2 cl 3 of the CASR Dictionary and includes a 'passenger transport operation' carried\n  out for 'hire or reward'.  'Passenger transport operation'\n  is defined in Part 2 cl 75 of the CASR Dictionary and means essentially the carriage\n  of any passengers unless the carriage is on a 'cost-sharing flight' (CASR Dictionary cl 75(2)(b)).\n\n  Therefore, if a flight is a 'cost-sharing flight' then it is excluded from the defition of\n  'passenger transport operation' which excludes it from the definition of 'air transport operation'\n  which in turn excludes the flight from being subject to Part 119.  Consequently (and someone\n  convolutedly), a 'cost-sharing flight' is a 'private operation'.\n\n  The term 'cost-sharing flight' is also defined in the CASR Dictionary and it imposes these limitations:\n\n  * Not more than five passengers plus the pilot (ie: six in total) can be carried on the flight;\n  * the pilot is not paid for the flight; and\n  * the pilot pays for his or her proportion of the flight costs.\n\n  For example, if there were a total of five people on board the flight including the pilot,\n  the pilot must pay at least 20% of the cost of the flight.\n\n  **Note:** It is not a requirement that passengers also pay an equal portion.  It is only necessary\n  that the pilot pays his or her portion as per above.\n\n  In summary, this means that a ${rpl_ppl_pilot} *can* charge to carry passengers as long as the\n  pilot also pays his or her share.\n---\ntemplate: pax_cpl\nsubject: Charging Passengers (CPL)\ncontent: |\n  A commercial pilot may, subject to some conditions, charge for carrying passengers.\n\n  According to CASR r 61.570 a holder of a commercial pilot licence may, subject to some conditions\n  relating to multi-crew aircraft and flight experience set out in CASR 61.570(a)(i) - (iii), pilot\n  any aircraft in any operation.\n\n  In short, a commercial pilot may charge for carriage of passengers.  However, commercial pilots should\n  be aware of other requirements, including CASR Parts 119, 121, 135 and 137, which may impose other\n  requirements on commercial operations.\n---\n# Because the answers to the RPL and PPL questions are so similar I have written only\n# one template.
